Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says a tweet sent from the FA Cup account mocking Harry Kane was "embarrassing".

The tweet was posted after Manchester United's 2-1 FA Cup semi-final victory over Spurs last weekend.

The message asked United and England defender Chris Smalling "What's in your pocket?" and included a short clip of him replying: "Harry Kane."

The Football Association apologised, and Pochettino said: "We need to protect our English players."

The Argentine, who was appointed Spurs boss in 2014, added: "We need to give them belief. We need to teach them, to educate, and this type of situation disappointed me a lot.

"For me, it was embarrassing. It was a shame because the FA is English football... and a potential captain like Harry Kane in the World Cup... I think was difficult to understand, very, very difficult."
