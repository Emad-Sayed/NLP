Brexiters set up demented â€peopleâ€™s courtsâ€™ 07-11-16 BREXIT supporters have set up a network of â€peopleâ€™s courtsâ€™ where justice is based on popular opinion. Anti-EU Britonsâ€™ dissatisfaction with the legal system has led to the creation of makeshift courts dealing with everything from witchcraft to disputes over borrowed garden tools. Accountant and peopleâ€™s judge Roy Hobbs said: â€œThe court convenes in my living room, with the legal cases argued by our â€barristersâ€™ Sandra the local florist and Degsy, an unemployed decorator whoâ€™s seen A Few Good Men five times. â€œOur biggest case so far has been the legality of Brexit. The court came to the unanimous decision that it is totally brilliant and anyone who disagrees deserves a toe up their arse. â€œYou can accuse anyone of anything. Last week we dealt with 48 cases of people being shortchanged at the local Sainsburyâ€™s, a French spy and an old lady who put a curse on a horse than made it go lame. â€œPunishments range from the stocks for not wearing a poppy to hanging for more serious crimes, such as men having long hair. â€œTomorrow Iâ€™ve got the case of a man whoâ€™s guilty of liking Nicola Sturgeon. He wonâ€™t be spouting his lies when heâ€™s being hit in the forehead by turnips.â€
