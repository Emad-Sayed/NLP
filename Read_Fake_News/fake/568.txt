Ivy Pollard, 73, from the backend of Brighton was all set for a binge-watching session of her favourite TV series when the tradesman who said he would arrive between 7am and Midday arrived between 7am and Midday. 
â€Iâ€™d just finished skinning up the first spliff of the day when the miracle took placeâ€™ she said. â€There was this unexpected knock at the door which I was hoping would be the new clown costume and accessories that I ordered 3 weeks ago!â€™ 
â€But it wasnâ€™t! It was the guy from Swirlpool! The one thing I wasnâ€™t expecting! Someone actually doing what they said they were going to do! The only time I experience that level of follow-through is on the toilet, or in my pull-ups, but even that doesnâ€™t happen all that often.â€™ 
â€It was all a bit embarrassing actually, because there wasnâ€™t anything wrong with the oven yet. The warranty had just expired so I knew it was only a matter of time. I thought I was being clever by booking an engineer straight away, confident that by the time he turned up, there would be something wrong with it.â€™ 
â€Mind you, he didnâ€™t mind. It turns out heâ€™s a big Game of Thrones fan as well. So we had a smoke and cracked on with the show. We had a jolly old day in the end, much to the chagrin of the other customers he was scheduled to see that day, but, then again, thatâ€™s tradesmen for you.â€™ Jodster
