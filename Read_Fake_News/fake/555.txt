With just days to go until the election, the Democrats are trying to salvage what little remains of Hillary Clintonâ€™s reputation. Time Magazine is now trying to defend the left-wing candidate with a last resortâ€“using the sexism card. 
As we get closer to Election Day, the left seems to be running out of excuses for their floundering candidate. Left-wing heads are on the verge of exploding. Not unlike the Galaxy S7. So, in Time Magazineâ€™s latest attempt to play off Hillary Clintonâ€™s FBI investigation , theyâ€™re digging deep and pulling outâ€¦ the sexism card ?! 
I am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. Itâ€™s us. 
No it isnâ€™t. Emailgate, or my preferred term â€œDikileaksâ€ is about a candidate mishandling confidential email. A flagrant abuse of the law and our national security. Also, Hillary Clinton doesnâ€™t represent all women. But nice try, dummy. 1 
The only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? Clinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what sheâ€™s doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. 
Actually yes, we can imagine this happening to a man. Men cannot hide behind their vagina, or Time readersâ€™ stupidity. Which means theyâ€™re usually punished. See also General Petraeus . Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is running for President. She might even win. While under FBI investigation. So â€œmuh sexismâ€ charges are lazy. And insulting to anyone who has three brain cells (like the writer of the Time article). 
The people are demanding Clinton act like moral exemplars, thundering from the pulpit like Jonathan Edwards or Cotton Mather. But Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Rush Limbaugh and their many conservative friends are not remotely Clintonâ€™s moral superiors. They are simply bullies, using gender discrimination to give a veneer of plausibility to their accusations. 
â€œMoral exemplarsâ€? â€œThundering from the pulpitâ€? No, Time Magazine feminist shill, Robin Lakoff. People are demanding Hillary Clinton not be a criminal liar. Not really that much to ask of someone who wants to lead the country. 
Trump and the other men on Time Magazineâ€™s list havenâ€™t done anything illegal. Thatâ€™s the difference, not their sex organs. Not their fashion choices. Evidence is piling up against Hillary more and more each day. Even the mainstream media is turning against her . Which means pantsuits or regular suits enter not into the Hillary is a Criminal equation. Her investigation isnâ€™t about sexism. Itâ€™s about Hillary breaking the law. 
But desperate Time calls for predictable, desperate measures: SEXISM! Just as any criticism of Obama was deemed RACISM. 
Leftists are running out of defenses for the pantsuited devil-spawn. So they resort to old hat tactics. Just like they do when they say Wikileaks is the product of Russian hackers. 
If we had a brick for every Clinton scandal and misdeed, the wall wouldnâ€™t cost a cent. Thereâ€™s nothing sexist about holding someone, male or female, accountable for their actions. In fact, itâ€™s kind of the opposite. It would be sexist NOT to hold Hillary to the same standards as all the boys. This is absolutely ridiculous. Itâ€™s not that we are against having a woman for president. Weâ€™re just against that woman being Hillary because she is corrupt and a pathological liar. Related Items
