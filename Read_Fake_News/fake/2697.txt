Floridaâ€™s â€œdeceptiveâ€ solar initiative, backed by utilities companies, loses support â€It's a monopoly wolf in solar sheep's clothingâ€™ By Nika Knight Posted on November 4, 2016 by Nika Knight 
As utilities companies funnel millions of dollars into a last-ditch effort to convince Florida voters to pass an anti-solar initiative, the latest polling data shows support for the measure falling . 
Floridaâ€™s Amendment 1 is â€œ deceptive ,â€ environmentalists argue, as it is written in pro-solar language but would in actuality block widespread adoption of solar power in the Sunshine State. 
The measure is backed by a political committee formed by utilities companies, which has so far raised more than $26 million to fund the campaign. 
â€œAs we like to say, â€itâ€™s a monopoly wolf in solar sheepâ€™s clothing,â€™â€ Dr. Stephen Smith, executive director of Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and a founding member of Floridians for Solar Choice, told the Sierra Clubâ€™s Sierra magazine. â€œWe are in a pitted battle to stop the utilities from choking off citizen-owned solar.â€ 
The initiative would â€œwrite peopleâ€™s right to own or lease solar panels and other equipment into the state constitution,â€ InsideClimate News explains . â€œBut it would also make it unconstitutional to require a utilityâ€™s non-solar customers to subsidize those who do go solar. Those subsidies have helped make home solar affordable and are the best incentive to push the fast-growing energy source to widespread use.â€ 
Support for the measure fell markedly after an audio recording leaked to the public last month in which a lobbyist working for electric companies bragged about the measure to industry insiders. 
The Miami Herald/Times , which released the recording, reported : 
Sal Nuzzo, a vice president at the James Madison Institute in Tallahassee, [ . . . ] called the amendment, which has received more than $21 million in utility industry financing, â€œan incredibly savvy maneuverâ€ that â€œwould completely negate anything they [pro-solar interests] would try to do either legislatively or constitutionally down the road,â€ according to an audio recording of the event supplied to the Herald/Times . 
He offered others a recommendation: â€œAs you guys look at policy in your state, or constitutional ballot initiatives in your state, remember this: Solar polls very well,â€ he said. 
â€œTo the degree that we can use a little bit of political jiu-jitsu and take what theyâ€™re kind of pinning us on and use it to our benefit either in policy, in legislation or in constitutional referendumsâ€”if thatâ€™s the direction you want to takeâ€”use the language of promoting solar, and kind of, kind of put in these protections for consumers that choose not to install rooftop. 
â€œIâ€™m discouraged as a citizen how far we have slipped and see Amendment 1 as a means of accelerating that decline in solar in Florida,â€ Graham said, according to the Miami Herald 
And Grahamâ€™s far from the only prominent voice to condemn the measure: â€œFormer Vice President Al Gore, speaking at a rally for Hillary Clinton, described the amendment as â€ phony baloney. â€ Carl Hiassen, Floridaâ€™s best-known opinion journalist, has called the proposal a â€ slick, oily fraud, â€ and even the usually apolitical Jimmy Buffett has urged a no vote, noted 
Such statements from opponents of the initiative have gone far to quell support, according to a new poll 
One of those voters was â€œBarbara Waks, a retiree who had already mailed in her early-voting ballot when the Herald story appeared. She said that she thought she was supporting renewable energy,â€ the New York Times reported 
â€œI felt so stupid,â€ she told the Times. â€œIâ€™m familiar with the political arena and the garbage that exists, but this is beyond the pale.
