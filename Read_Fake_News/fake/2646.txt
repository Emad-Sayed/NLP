The conservative political machine has been working overtime to try to deny that the government of the Russian Federation is interfering with the American election in support of Republican nominee Donald Trump â€“ but this explosive investigation by former Daily Show correspondent Samantha Bee proves once and for all that dictator Vladimir Putin is using every tool at his disposal to tilt the scale in favor of Trump. 
Samantha Bee, now the host of her own show, traveled to Moscow to interview two of the â€œthinkfluencers,â€ members of Putinâ€™s underground troll farms that pose as Americans online and flood social media with pro-Russian and pro-Trump propaganda. 
â€œThe reason Iâ€™m hired is to make simple people change their mind about their vote and also about Russiaâ€ said one woman, who admitted she identifies herself as a Nebraskan housewife online. When asked why they thought their propaganda was working, she replied it was because Americans are â€œlazy and they believe everything they read.â€
