November 10, 2016 French privacy row over mass ID database 
A French state watchdog has called for the suspension of a database that could end up holding the biometric details of 60 million people. The aim of a single â€œmega-databaseâ€ is to fight identity fraud and improve efficiency. But, as Paul Kirby explains, there are fears the database could be abused not only by hackers but by state intelligence too, Whatâ€™s the database for? The single database would not be used in judicial investigations, ministers insist. Rather, it would help tackle identity fraud by comparing one set of digital fingerprints with another. Franceâ€™s interior ministry wants the Secure Electronic Documents (TES) to collect all the information on an individual held on two separate databases that have details of peopleâ€™s passports and national ID cards. Only children under 12 would be exempt. It would include an individualâ€™s name, address, marital status, eye colour, weight, photograph and fingerprints. Itâ€™s merely an administrative register, argues Justice Minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas. Its only legal use would be when data need to be requisitioned.
