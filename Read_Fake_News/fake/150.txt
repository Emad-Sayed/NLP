REPORT: Megyn Trashes Trump, Newtâ€¦ Then Murdoch Announces Replacements Are Available 
â€œAmazing how many addresses you get from Google. Going again until Saturday and all next week. BAAHAA BAAHAA.â€ 
He then tagged someone else â€” itâ€™s unclear if that was just to alert them to the post or to let them know that he voted for them. 
After his posts where he laughed and boasted about committing voter fraud, Dougherty apologized on Facebook: â€œI apologize for the insensitive post. Lesson learned about my stupidity.â€ 
Itâ€™s difficult to say whether Dougherty apologized because he didnâ€™t do it and had made a stupid joke or if he was simply trying to avoid being prosecuted. 
Although we canâ€™t tell for sure right now whatâ€™s true here, Doughertyâ€™s comments at the very least are a reminder of how important voter ID laws are. 
If everyone were required to present identification to vote, Dougherty wouldnâ€™t have made his â€œjokeâ€ about how easy it was to commit voter fraud â€” and if he actually tried to do what he boasted about on Facebook, voter ID laws would stop such a thing. 
For all we know, Dougherty may not even be a Clinton supporter; he could have been trying to make a point about voter fraud and the dirty tricks committed by Democrats. Doubtful, but who knows? 
No matter what his party affiliation or whether or not he actually did what he boasted about, he intentionally or not made the case for strong voter ID laws.
