â€œYOU just have to show that youâ€™re willing to go that extra mile,â€ said Keith Gernon, angling the webcam on his laptop to give a perfect shot of his bed, where his girlfriend Cathy Wilson is already waiting. 
â€œWe havenâ€™t left the house without a cash deposit with us for the past four months, just so we can grab any property that comes available to rent. But weâ€™re always beaten to itâ€¦ so weâ€™ve decided to try something newâ€. 
Gernon and Wilson, both 27, are speaking exclusively to WWN about their difficulties in securing a one bedroom flat in Dublin city centre, and have decided to offer potential landlords a daily sex video broadcast live over a webcam in a bid to give them the â€edgeâ€™ over other renters. 
â€œThe minute a flat goes up on Daft, we mail the landlord and put on a bit of a show for them, letting them know thereâ€™s more where that came from,â€ said Wilson, undressing quickly in a bid to secure a bedsit above a butcherâ€™s shop which just got listed at â‚¬1,800 a month. 
â€œIf you think youâ€™re going to just show up and get the place, forget it. Itâ€™s like trying to get bread in Russia in the 80s. We donâ€™t even bother going to viewings now, we just send over a sexy clip and take it from thereâ€. 
While landlords are open to webcam shows as part of their letting packages, people looking to buy a house rather than rent in Dublin must agree to sign up for a 24-hour Truman Show style existence with cameras in every room of the house.
