Michael Moore was super excited to learn that Republicans were driving traffic to his film , â€œTrumpland,â€ by passing around on social media a four-minute clip, even though he claims it was doctored. Thatâ€™s not cool â€” if anyoneâ€™s going to doctor the footage in a Michael Moore movie, its going to be Michael Moore. 
Obviously Mooreâ€™s not a Donald Trump fan, and like many other liberals this weekend, heâ€™s not an Anthony Weiner fan. Setting aside Judicial Watchâ€™s lawsuit against the State Department, Hillary Clinton almost looked to be in the clear a few months back, but now her email shenanigans have returned to the front pages, all because of Weinerâ€™s compulsion to send vulgar selfies online. Unbelievable that once again Hillary has to suffer the abuse of men & their dickish behavior. Bubba, Weiner, Trump, Newt, Comey. Sick of it.

What did Bill Clinton do that was so wrong? Hillary long ago established that he was the victim of a vast right-wing conspiracy. And Weiner? Sure, be angry at him for the way heâ€™s treated his wife and the women heâ€™s sexted, but there would be no sensitive emails on his laptop if Hillary and company had simply used the secure government email accounts provided to them. 
Moore was just getting started on his misandrist rant, and when heâ€™s on a roll, itâ€™s best to step away until heâ€™s finished it. The day can't come soon enough when women will take charge. Public policy will not be decided by dick pix, Tic Tacs, grab-assers or the GOP.

What about all those soccer moms tooling around in minivans and SUVs? The ones manufactured in Michigan, by union workers, in factories with smokestacks? And donâ€™t be so quick to count out women   atomic bomb, either. @MMFlint You might to do a little reading on that atom bomb thingie. You could not be more wrong.
