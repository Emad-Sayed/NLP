Sen. Bernie Sanders laid out the ways he would leverage his popularity that emerged from the Democratic primary to continue to push Hillary Clinton to the left if she wins the presidency next month. 
In an interview published Monday with The Washington Post, Sanders argued that the Democratic Party is â€œmore progressiveâ€ than its presidential nominee. 
He emphasized that he saw it as his role to â€œdemand that the Democratic Party implementâ€ the party platform his allies helped shape, and would be â€œvigorously in oppositionâ€ if Clinton attempted to abandon the platformâ€™s progressive elements. 
â€œThe leverage that I think I take into the Senate is taking on the entire Democratic Party establishment, and, you know, taking on a very powerful political organization with the Clinton people,â€ Sanders said. He then referenced the number of states he won during the primary, 22. 
â€œThat gives me a lot of leverage, leverage that I intend to use,â€ he added. 
The Vermont senator also emphasized that he would not be cowed by the knowledge that his proposals would not be well received by a likely Republican-controlled House of Representatives.
