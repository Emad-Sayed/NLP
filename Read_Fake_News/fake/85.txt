We know that Obama and Hillary want to take away of Second Amendment right. 
They say weâ€™re just paranoid freaks for thinking that way. 
But we know, right? 
This undercover video exposes a close Obama advisor speaking about Obamaâ€™s â€œissueâ€ which is to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence. 
FYI, HANDGUNS ARE ILLEGAL IN BRITAIN â€“ YOU CAN ONLY OWN â€œSPORTING RIFLESâ€ AND THATâ€™S SUBJECT TO LICENSING. 
Donâ€™t think it can happen here?
