President Donald Trump has given very hard thought into who will be in his Cabinet. He has several names in mind, names that will literally change America and CNN doesnâ€™t like this at all. Well, too bad! VIA Conservative 101 According to Politico , some of those names include Gingrich for Secretary of State, Mnuchin, a 17 year veteran of Goldman Sachs for Treasure Secretary and Mayor Giuliani for Attorney General. And of course Sheriff David Clarke as the Homeland Security Secretary. He has been an incredible patriotic American and leader in Blue Lives Matter. CNN was terrified by this. â€œI think the one major flag I have is that someone like Sheriff Clarke would be considered as his Homeland Security secretary? Someone who I very much see as if heâ€™s not a terrorist inciting terrorism?â€ said CNN commentator Angela Rye. â€œIf people are afraid of Sheriff Clarke, afraid of the policies which he represents, I think thatâ€™s terrorism,â€ she said. This of course, makes no sense. You canâ€™t just call people who disagree with you terrorists. Check out the video below and see for yourself. 
Now, this makes me wonderâ€¦ what gives Angela the right to call an honest person like Sheriff Clarke a terrorist? Is it jealousy? 
You canâ€™t call someone a terrorist just because you donâ€™t agree with them. Itâ€™s absurd! 
What are your thoughts on this? Do you think that Anglea Rye is a disgrace to journalism?
