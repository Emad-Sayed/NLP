Media Roll Out Welcome Mat for â€Humanitarianâ€™ War in Syria Media Roll Out Welcome Mat for â€Humanitarianâ€™ War in Syria By 0 49 Hillary Clinton told Goldman Sachs that a no-fly zone is â€œgoing to kill a lot of Syrians.â€ (cc photo: Gage Skidmore) 
As she marches toward the US presidency, Hillary Clinton has stepped up her promotion of the idea that a no-fly zone in Syria could â€œsave livesâ€ and â€œhasten the end of the conflictâ€ that has devastated that country since 2011. 
It has now been revealed, of course, that Clinton hasnâ€™t always expressed the same optimism about the no-fly zone in private. The Intercept (10/10/16 ) reported on Clintonâ€™s recently leaked remarks in a closed-door speech to Goldman Sachs in 2013: 
To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so weâ€™re not putting our pilots at riskâ€”youâ€™re going to kill a lot of Syrians. 
Other relevant characters, such as US Joint Chiefs of Staff chair Joseph Dunford ( Daily Caller , 9/26/16 ), have warned that a no-fly zone in Syria would simply intensify the conflictâ€”which presumably isnâ€™t the best way to hasten its end. 
Luckily for those who prefer to rally around illogic, however, plenty of media have already rolled out the welcome mat for peddlers of the â€œhumanitarianâ€ vision of increased Western military interference in Syria. The New York Times â€ Nicholas Kristof ( 10/6/16 ) argues against â€œObamaâ€™s paralysisâ€ and for â€œmore robust strategies advocated by Hillary Clinton.â€ 
The New York Times â€™ self-appointed savior of women , Nicholas Kristof ( 10/6/16 ), invoked the plight of a young Syrian girl in Aleppo to conclude that Obamaâ€™s alleged â€œparalysisâ€ on Syria â€œhas been linked to the loss of perhaps half a million livesâ€ in the country, as well as to â€œthe rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State,â€ among other unpleasant outcomes. We have no â€œexcuse,â€ weâ€™re told, for â€œfailing to respond to mass atrocities.â€ 
Never mind that the rise of ISIS has much to do with that mass atrocity known as the US invasion of Iraq, thanks to which many young Iraqi girls and other human beings have suffered rape, mutilation and death. Itâ€™s convenient for certain industries, at least, when US weapons are deemed the solution for problems US weapons helped to create in the first place. 
Furthermore, plenty of US weapons continue to flow to countries known for arming and funding ISIS and similar outfitsâ€”an arrangement unlikely to be rectified by a no-fly zone targeting the Syrian government and the Russians. 
USA Today ( 10/8/16 ), meanwhile, ran an opinion piece by an American doctor who worked briefly at a now-destroyed hospital in Aleppo, arguing that the US â€œshould lead the way in establishing real no-fly zones, either under United Nations auspices or with the British and the Frenchâ€â€”because â€œotherwise, our inaction will continue to be an embarrassment and stand as an example of our spineless irresponsibility.â€ 
But considering that there has already been plenty of US action in Syriaâ€”including the mistaken â€œpulverizationâ€ of whole families with childrenâ€”it would seem weâ€™ve already exhibited a fair amount of lethal irresponsibility. 
Beyond the opinion pages, media figures are pushing the â€œhumanitarianâ€ approach with varying degrees of subtlety. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd ( 10/16/16 ) recently pressed Vice President Joe Biden on the lack of a no-fly zone over Aleppo, suggesting that the Obama administration will â€œlook back and wonder what if? What if? What if? What if?â€ 
Of course, no campaign for saving lives with bombs would be complete without everyoneâ€™s favorite examples of feel-good destruction from the former Yugoslavia. The Washington Post ( 9/9/16 ) hosted an opinion by Bosnia and Herzegovinaâ€™s first ambassador to the UN, Muhamed Sacirbey, straightforwardly headlined: â€œWestern Military Intervention Saved Lives in Bosnia. It Can Work in Syria, Too.â€ 
Sacirbey warns that â€œSyriaâ€™s largest city is on the brink of starvation. Bombed from the skies and besieged on the ground, Aleppoâ€™s 2 million residents may soon be exterminated.â€ Gone, apparently, are the days of factchecking, when someone at the Post might have alerted the author to the reality that the vast majority of Aleppoâ€™s residents live in government-controlled areas and are thus not under attack by said government. 
Comparing Aleppo to besieged Sarajevo, Sacirbey determines that Sarajevans ultimately â€œescaped many of the horrors now awaiting Aleppoâ€™s residentsâ€¦ because NATO opted (albeit belatedly and, too often, inadequately) to uphold its responsibility to protect Bosnian civilians.â€ 
After lauding Bosniaâ€™s no-fly zone, Sacirbey pulls this prediction out of a hat: â€œLimited military intervention in Syria would save civilian lives, perhaps as many as 200 a week.â€ 
In their indispensable essay for Monthly Review ( 10/07 ), â€œThe Dismantling of Yugoslavia: A Study in In humanitarian Intervention (and a Western Liberal-Left Intellectual and Moral Collapse),â€ Edward S. Herman and David Peterson make it unavoidably clear that the Westâ€™s business in Bosnia had nothing to do with saving livesâ€”and much to do with the contrary. 
The Bill Clinton administration, they note, actively sabotaged agreements to end the war at an earlier date, while â€œhelping arm the Bosnian Muslims and Croatians and helping bring thousands of Mujahedin to fight in Bosnia.â€ Americaâ€™s support in this case for jihadistsâ€”a secret alliance also discussed by scholar Tariq Ali ( Guardian , 9/9/06 )â€”further complicates the assumption that the US is somehow capable of fixing the current jihad problem. 
In predictable fashion, US media led the charge to the Bosnian intervention ( Extra! , 10-11/92 ), dutifully painting the Serbs as demonic aggressors, parroting inflated Bosnian casualty estimates and otherwise behaving as the official PR arm of the establishment. 
A similar performance was repeated shortly thereafter with Kosovo, where minimal regard was given to actual facts on the ground and the specter of Serbian-waged genocide was instead hysterically invoked. Noam Chomsky ( Monthly Review , 9/08 ) cited various reports, including from the British government, that the US-backed Kosovo Liberation Army was actually responsible for more killings than the Serbs in the run-up to NATOâ€™s bombing campaignâ€”a project that naturally also managed to kill several thousand people. 
While Yugoslavia has now been fully dismantled, the myth of Western humanitarian intervention there has emerged unscathed; in his recent dispatch on Syria, Kristof brought up Kosovo as an example of how â€œthe military toolbox has saved lives.â€ 
To be sure, â€œsaving livesâ€ is a much nobler goal than, say, endowing NATO with a new lease on life or clearing the way for total neoliberal assault â€”two outcomes of the Westâ€™s Yugoslav ventures. Hence the utility, as Herman and Peterson write, of the â€œedifice of lies that serves and protects the Western interventions in the former Yugoslaviaâ€”and which laid the ideological foundations for the US role in Iraq and for future so-called humanitarian interventions.â€ 
In Syriaâ€™s brutal war, meanwhile, humanitarian motives will presumably be utilized as a veneer for pursuing more fundamental goals, like neutralizing resistance to US/Israeli regional designs and promoting that profitable sort of chaos that produces massive arms sales. 
And just as those in the West who failed to leap onto the bandwagon in Yugoslavia were denounced as â€œ apologists for genocide â€ and the like, opponents of increased Western military action in Syria will be increasingly assailed as pro-Assad fanatics with Syrian blood on their hands. 
One strong candidate for fanatic-hood is Greg Shupak, who in a recent Jacobin magazine dispatch ( 10/20/16 ) dared to argue that a no-fly zone â€œwould actually represent an escalation of war that is guaranteed to harm civilians in the name of protecting them.â€ Emphasizing that opposition to said zone is not meant in any way â€œto minimize or rationalize the torture, mass killings or severe sieges enacted by the Syrian state and its allies,â€ Shupak continues: â€œThe imminent question, however, is not, â€Is the Syrian government good?â€™; itâ€™s â€Should America drop more bombs on Syria?â€™â€ 
Because, at the end of the day, humanitarian war just isnâ€™t humanly possible.
