Following Americaâ€™s shock election result, a voter has complained of increasing polarisation in the country between people who agree with her and â€œignorant scumâ€. 
â€œI just donâ€™t recognise this country any more,â€ she said sadly. â€œI remember a time we could discuss things in a civil manner, with everyone being respectful of each otherâ€™s opinions.â€ 
â€œNowadays this seems to be impossible, due to the existence of people who obviously must be racist, misogynist knuckle-dragging arsewipes since they disagree with me.â€ 
She also expressed concern that her political opponents harboured authoritarian tendencies, and said the sooner they were rounded up and put into camps the better â€œso that a more inclusive and tolerant political discourse can flourish againâ€. YaBasta
