â€œI was never given any kind of dress code. I was never asked beforehand to show my wardrobe.â€ Streeter (left) and the 76ers home court at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia 
â€œI also felt it was important to express the ongoing challenges and ongoing injustice we face as a black community within the United States of America â€” thatâ€™s very important to me,â€ Streeter said. â€œYes, we live in the greatest country in the world but there are issues that we cannot ignore. This canâ€™t be ignored.â€ Advertisement - story continues below 
â€œI was angry, extremely, extremely angry and disappointed and honestly brought to tears by all of it. It broke my heart,â€ she said. â€œHonestly, I was very excited about being able to perform the national anthem. I was really looking forward to that.â€ 
Firstly, pro tip: The more times you say â€œhonestlyâ€ about something, the more it becomes exponentially less likely to the listener that they will believe youâ€™re being honest. In this case, I believe Streeter honestly wanted to make a point, not sing the national anthem, which is the matter of contention here. 
The national anthem is sung to honor the heroes who have served (and died) for our country before major events. It isnâ€™t time to make a point or â€œhave a discussionâ€ (a discussion, may I add, that usually takes the form of a monologue from whatever social justice warrior is giving it â€” who usually acts surprised and disappointed when people have a real discussion and push back against their disrespect of the flag). 
If youâ€™re singing the national anthem, it isnâ€™t about your opinions. It isnâ€™t about your talent. It isnâ€™t about what youâ€™ve done. Advertisement - story continues below
