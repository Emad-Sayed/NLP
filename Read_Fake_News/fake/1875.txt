posted by Eddie Bill Clinton seen walking his dogs Buster and Frank at his mansion in the Maldives. This afternoon , WikiLeaks says sources in the Clinton Foundation inadvertently leaked the details of an apparently secret deal with Christieâ€™s International Real Estate in New York. Several recorded phone conversations between Christieâ€™s executives and Clinton board member, FrankGuistra, clearly show that a deal for â€œThe Imperial Maldivesâ€ had been closed. â€œThe Imperial Maldivesâ€ is a development of 185 water villas set above the turquoise waters of the North Male Atoll. According to the recordings, the agreed price was $200 million (U.S). Also according to the recordings, this deal began the morning after the last debate. The morning after Trump told Clinton he would appoint a special prosecutor and put her in prison. Mr. Guistra is heard to say, â€œTrump can drag his sorry orange ass down to the Maldives if he wants her so bad. Thereâ€™s no extradition treaty!â€ [laughing] The Clinton camp is very tight-lipped at the moment and no comments from Clinton Foundation board members. WikiLeaks seems to suggest that the Clintons are feeling the pressure of a world-wide criminal organization becoming frayed at the seams, and are looking for a hideout until they can hatch their next diabolical plan for world domination. Or, those fuckers just need a real good vacation. source:
