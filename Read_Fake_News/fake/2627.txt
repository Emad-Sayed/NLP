â€œDavid Duke Slams the NFL and Black Lives Matter in Monday NIght Football Game Senate Campaign Ads. NFL Bosses cringe.â€ 
During the middle of Monday Night Football, Senate candidate Slams NFL for their salute to Black Panthers and Black Lives Matter in Superbowl which incited Black racist shootings in Dallas and our own Baton Rouge. 
Thank God, under campaign rules, there is still some freedom of speech in America! 
Donâ€™t you love it!
