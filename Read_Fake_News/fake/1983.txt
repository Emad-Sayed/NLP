Sioux Falls, IA | During his 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton allegedly had sexual intercourse with cattle off of Tom Bradyâ€™s family dairy farm. 
The family farm which was owned by Tom Bradyâ€™s father at the time, Willow Brady Jr., was often visited by the Clinton family when they were in the area. 
â€œMy dad and Bill Clintonâ€™s step dad were like brothers. They often visited us on the holidays when I was a kid. Bill even knew the cows names by heart. That always surprised meâ€ recalls the 64-year-old, third-generation dairy farmer. 
â€œ My father was a strong Democratic party supporter all his life and a big Bill Clinton fan, so I never found the strength to tell him the truth before he passed away â€ 
Sex, drugs and cattle 
During the 1992 Iowa caucus, the Clinton campaign stopped by for a night of festivities at the Bradyâ€™s farm, a night Tom Brady says he will never forget. 
â€œThe Clinton team came by and we drank a lot and all was merry before they started indulging in hard drugs, thatâ€™s when everything went wrongâ€ he recalls, visibly distraught by the whole affair. 
â€œI donâ€™t know about all those stories about him sexually assaulting women, but I sure as hell know he assaulted one of our cows because I was there and I saw him do it with my own eyes and believe me, itâ€™s not something Iâ€™d wish my worst enemy to live to seeâ€ he told local reporters. 
â€œIâ€™m sorry for the Clinton family, but as a God-fearing Christian, I just had to let the truth be knownâ€ he adds. 
Bill Clinton has been personally accused publicly by seventeen women of sexual misconduct between 1972 and 1997. The former US President also admitted to having had an â€œinappropriate relationshipâ€ with Monica Lewinsky while she worked at the White House in 1995 and 1996.
