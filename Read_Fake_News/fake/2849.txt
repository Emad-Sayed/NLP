â€œMy word to all black Americans, one thing I would like to say: Letâ€™s not be deceived,â€ a woman named Gloria told MSNBC. 
â€œLook at the record. Look at the promises that have been made over the past from the Democratic party. Weâ€™re not voting for a party, weâ€™re voting for a man who has been standing by all citizâ€¦ He loves America. We need somebody that loves America. And he also loves all people, all people. And thereâ€™s that perception out there that he has no black supporters. WRONG! He does.â€
