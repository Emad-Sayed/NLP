October 26, 2016 Knesset Speaker asks Vatican to join battle against UNESCOâ€™s denial of history 
The resolution, the Speaker wrote, â€œis an assault on history and is deeply offensive to both Christianity and Judaism. The denial of the historicity of the two Jerusalem Temples and the Temple Mount as recounted in both the Old and New Testaments is a terrible indictment of the international community when repeatedly adopted by an important UN body. 
â€œThe outrageous repudiation of the millennia-old bond between Judaism and its holiest shrines in Jerusalem is a blatant attempt to rewrite history,â€ he added. â€œThe annals of both our religions cannot be erased by raised hands and counted votes.â€ 
Edelstein said the time has come for the international community to pass a resolution reaffirming Jerusalem as the holy city for the three major monotheistic religions, â€œa city where the two Temples stood and from which the Word of G-d was first promulgated to humanity by our prophets.â€ 
Education Minister Naftali Bennett called UNESCOâ€™s decision â€œa denial of history, and history will erase the embarrassing decision.
