Whispers of â€œpaybackâ€ are being directed at Hillary Clinton after she decried as â€œunprecedentedâ€ the surprise FBI revival of its probe of her email scandal. 
Thatâ€™s because 24 years ago, as former President George H.W. Bush was surging back against challenger Bill Clinton, a special prosecutor raised new charges against Bush in the Iran-Contra probe, prompting Clinton to claim he was running against a â€œculture of corruption.â€ 
Many Republicans claimed that the indictment made by special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh against former Reagan-era Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger the weekend before the 1992 election cost Bush a second term. The indictment, later thrown out, challenged Bushâ€™s claim that he did not know about a controversial arms-for-hostages deal that dogged the Reagan-Bush administration. 
When it came, Clinton seized on it, saying for example, â€œSecretary Weinbergerâ€™s note clearly shows that President Bush has not been telling the truth when he says he was out of the loop.â€ Clinton added, â€œIt demonstrates that President Bush knew and approved of President Reaganâ€™s secret deal to swap arms for hostages.â€
