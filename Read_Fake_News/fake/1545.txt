  
With Hillary Clinton making history this election season by becoming the first women nominated by a major party, the sexism has been on full display. The misogynists on the Right have questioned her health, her stamina, and everything in between. That is, of course, code for â€œthe little woman doesnâ€™t belong in the Oval Office.â€ However, one Texas Republican has taken the misogyny to a whole other level. 
Meet Sid Miller, the Agriculture Commissioner for the state of Texas. He is also a former lawmaker. Miller, like most Republicans, doesnâ€™t make his hatred for Hillary Clinton any secret. Instead, he somehow thought that it was perfectly appropriate to take to Twitter and express his feelings in a most disgusting way while tweeting about the polls. Millerâ€™s tweet reads: 
â€œTRUMP 44 Cunt 43,â€ punctuated with a cheering â€œGo Trump Go!â€ 
In the predictable firestorm after, Miller tried to make the public believe that his account was hacked. Millerâ€™s staff hastily relesed this defense of his post: 
â€œThe campaign was retweeting information today and inadvertently retweeted a tweet that they were not aware contained a derogatory term. The tweet was taken down as soon as possible. Commissioner Miller finds the term vulgar and offensive and apologizes to anyone who may have seen it.â€ 
Thereâ€™s a problem with that, though: The tweet was not a retweet. It was simply a tweet. Therefore, either Sid Miller himself or someone on his staff wrote this: 
Naturally, Miller is Donald Trumpâ€™s number one man in Texas, according to the Texas Tribune . No surprise there. Further, Miller is no stranger to making tasteless and offensive jokes with regards to Hillary. Here is one that is just a few hours old as of this writing: 
That tweet written in reference to the fact that the reason Hillaryâ€™s emails are in the news again is because of disgraced Congressman Anthony Weinerâ€™s sexting scandals. 
So, in other words, this Sid Miller character is the perfect Donald Trump supporter â€“ a misogynistic and deeply ignorant asshat who canâ€™t stand the idea of losing to a woman.
