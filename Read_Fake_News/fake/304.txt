During a panel discussion on Wednesday's â€œAnderson Cooper 360,â€ Republican strategist and CNN regular Ana Navarro went off on Newt Gingrich over his meltdown on â€œThe Kelly Fileâ€â€” during which he angrily accused Kelly of being â€œ fascinated with sex .â€ 
After Cooper referred to Gingrich's rant as â€œironic,â€ Navarro jumped to take issue, 'correcting' the host before torching Gingrich over the treatment of his wife: 
â€œI think the word you were looking for was â€hypocritical.' Remember Newt Gingrichâ€™s wife? When he was running in 2012, told all of us, told the media [...] Gingrich offered her the choice between an open marriage or a divorce. 
So maybe, just maybe, if all of that baggage is on your shoulders, maybe you shouldnâ€™t be the surrogate out there wagging your finger and accusing the woman who was reporting on sexual assault. 
Let me explain it slowly â€” sexual assault and sex are two things. One is unwanted. One is wanted. So maybe they need to understand that to begin with.â€

Incidentally, following the release of the now-infamous leaked 2005 video in which Trump brags about grabbing women by the p***y, Navarro angrily yelled the word during a CNN panel discussion after Hughes chastised her for saying it on-air. 
We'll go ahead and put Ana down as a â€œmaybeâ€ for Trump.
