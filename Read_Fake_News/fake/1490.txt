Throughout this election, Hillary Clinton has been claiming to be a â€œwarrior for womenâ€ who will do everything in her power to help victims of sexual assault. Thatâ€™s why it came as bad news to her when the video above this story surfacedâ€¦ 
Infowars reported that the video shows child rape victim Kathy Shelton explain how Clinton allowed her rapist to go free when she was his defense lawyer, even thought she knew he was guilty. Afterwards, Clinton was caught on a recording laughing about the fact that sheâ€™d just knowingly set a child rapist free. 
â€œHe took a lie detector test,â€ Clinton said on the recording, according to The American Thinker. â€œI had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs (laughs).â€ 
SHARE this story so we can spread Sheltonâ€™s story and let people see who Hillary Clinton REALLY is!
