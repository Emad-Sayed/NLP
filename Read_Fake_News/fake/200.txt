This guy is full of hot air. 
Via NY Post : The de Blasio administration is trying to limit the number of food trucks in the city by claiming that each hot-dog and kabob cart causes more pollution than a truck ride to Los Angeles. 
Deputy Health Commissioner Corinne Schiff made the claim at a City Council hearing Wednesday, in an apparent effort to sink a bill that would nearly double the number of food-vendor permits in the city by 2023 . 
â€œMeat grilling is a significant source of air pollution in the city,â€ Schiff said. â€œOne additional vendor grilling meat emits an amount of particle pollution in one day equivalent to what a diesel truck emits driving 3,500 miles.â€ 
The new bill would boost the number of permits to 8,000 by 2023 and also create an enforcement team to sniff out violations. 
Since 1983, the number of street-food vending permits has remained steady at 4,235. But there are likely more carts than that on the streets, as some vendors simply open shop without a license and work until they are caught. 
Schiff argued any increase in the number of food carts needs to come with regulations stipulating that the carts operate in a more environmentally friendly manner. 
City Councilman Mark Levine (D-Manhattan), who is sponsoring the bill to increase the permits, wondered if this was already the case. â€œWe have laws in the city about air quality that currently stipulate that any food establishment has got to have a hood over a grill,â€ Levine said. â€œIs that not currently the law?â€ 
Schiff, however, said there are no such laws regulating the carts as she suggested the proposals be delayed to ensure better pollution safeguards. 
â€œWe really see this as an opportunity to work with the council to think through how we might use this modernization act to improve air quality,â€ she said. â€œThe current laws donâ€™t actually control the emissions that weâ€™re concerned about.â€ 
Business-improvement districts and residents throughout the city also pushed for delays on increasing vendor permits, saying there are too many already in some neighborhoods, but welcomed increased enforcement. 
â€œThe enforcement idea is a great idea,â€ said Ellen Baer, co-chair of the NYC BID Association. â€œLetâ€™s see if this works, letâ€™s see how it works, letâ€™s see if itâ€™s sufficiently funded, letâ€™s see how many resources they need â€” before we start adding to the chaos.â€ 
But street vendors argued theyâ€™ve waited too long for reforms that would allow them to transition from operating illegally to legally. 
Sean Basinski, director of the Street Vendor Project, described the bills as â€œfar from our dream,â€ but said he supports most of what they call for. â€œIt is a reasonable compromise,â€ he said. â€œVendors have been waiting 35 years for this change . . . We certainly welcome a study being done, but we donâ€™t think that should delay the progress that needs to be made. The time for reform is now.â€ 
Before the hearing, some vendors rallied outside, demanding that city officials and police stop harassing them and treating them like criminals . The bill will remain before the committee while members discuss possible changes.
