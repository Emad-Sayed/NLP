Share on Facebook Share on Twitter A few years ago, Neil deGrasse said that yes, extraterrestrials may be visiting our planet, and people do see Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), but he also stated that it is a big leap for one to assume a UFO is of extraterrestrial in origin. ( source )   As you will see from the information below, itâ€™s not a big leap, which is why so many other scientists around the world support the extraterrestrial hypotheses. Itâ€™s also important to note that this article is not implying that Carl Saga is a â€badâ€™ person. If this information is indeed true, we still do not know the circumstances and details of it. It is a common occurrence for â€UFOâ€™s to be tracked on military radar , and more and more people are starting to believe that these objects are of extraterrestrial origin. and there is a good amount of evidence to believe that. One reason for this is the disclosure of evidence supporting such a hypothesis in recent years. If you want to see a fraction of that evidence, you can check out this article or the one pertaining to military radar linked above, or you can visit the exopolitics section of our website, here . If you really want to go in depth and read some proper studies on this topic, you can check out Richard Dolanâ€™s books . They are a great place to start, he is a brilliant academic and one of the worldâ€™s leading researchers on the topic of UFOs. Saganâ€™s Close Colleague Apart from the congressional hearings on this subject, and the fairly recent citizens hearing that took place, along with the release of official documentation, there has been a surge in people believing that ETs are real because of the work of scholars like Dr. Brian Oâ€™Leary. Brian was a close colleague of Carl Sagan, who recruited him to teach at Cornell University in the late 1960â€™s, where he researched and lectured in the department of astronomy and physics. After Cornell, he taught physics, astronomy, and science policy assessment at various academic institutions, including the University of California Berkeley, Hampshire College, and finally at Princeton University from 1976 to 1981. After this he went on to Washington, where he would become an advisor to various political leaders, presidential candidates, and the United States Congress.   Before all of this, Dr. Oâ€™Leary was a NASA astronaut and a member of the sixth group of astronauts selected by NASA in August of 1967. One year after that, as mentioned above, Sagan recruited him to teach at Cornell. Oâ€™Leary was also a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as secretary of the American Geophysical Unionâ€™s Planetology Section. Furthermore, he was the team leader of the Asteroidal Resources Group for NASAâ€™s Ames Summer Study on Space Settlements. He was a founding board member of the International Association for New Science as well as founding president of the New Energy Movement. â€œCarl Sagan called me from Cornell and asked me to join the faculty. I accepted the offer and spent many years at Cornell in the astronomy department, planetary science department. And I became very creative in research then, but still within the bounds of western science, but in the planetary exploration program. That was for a period of about a decade.â€ ( source )( source ) As you can see, his resume is more than extensive, and Oâ€™Leary is just one out of hundreds of people with this type of distinguished background to blow the lid on the extraterrestrial phenomenon. I use his video below in a lot of my extraterrestrial/UFO related articles, and I apologize to our regular readers, but I feel itâ€™s always useful to share with readers who have yet to come across it. The clip is taken from the Thrive documentary which, if you havenâ€™t seen yet, I highly recommend. You can read his entire biography â€” though Iâ€™ll warn you it is quite large â€” HERE . Above Iâ€™ve provided only the highlights of his impressive career. Brian passed away shortly after this video was taken. Apparently it happened shortly after having a heart attack and a diagnosis of intestinal cancer. What He Said Carl Sagan Did He had some interesting things to say during a live interview with Kerry Cassidy of Project Camelot (view full live interview here , read transcript of video here ). Oâ€™Leary and Sagan were close for a number of years, but had a little bit of a falling out when Oâ€™Leary decided to leave Cornell. In the interview, he remarked: It wasâ€¦ One very cold snowy day in May, I landed in Syracuse, and there was a horizontal blizzard â€” in May â€” and I said: Thatâ€™s it for upstate New York . And Carl thought that was very frivolous. Because, of course, he was kind of an empire-builder kind of guy; and he also had a huge ego. After he left, Oâ€™Leary started to examine some of Carlâ€™s work. He said that the famous â€œFaceâ€ in Cydonia on Mars â€” photographed by Viking in 1975, this enormous formation (about a mile across) resembled a human face and created a major buzz at the time â€” was tampered with by Sagan before being released to the public: It was very, very disappointing to me, because not only was Carl wrong, he also fudged data. He published a picture of the â€œFaceâ€ in Parade Magazine , a popular article, saying that the â€œFaceâ€ was just a natural formation, but he doctored the picture to make it not look like a face. At this time, Sagan and Oâ€™Leary were arguably the worldâ€™s two leading experts on Mars, and they entered into many disagreements over that face. This rift was made clear in Oâ€™Learyâ€™s publication in 1998, â€œCarl Sagan & I: On Opposite Sides of Mars.â€ It can be found in The Case for the Face: Scientists Examine the Evidence for Alien Artifacts on Mars , eds. Stanley V. McDaniel and Monica Rix Paxson. Kempton, IL: Adventures Unlimited Press. In May of 1990, Oâ€™Leary released a paper titled â€œ Analysis of Images of the Face on Mars and Possible Intelligent Origin â€ which only further demonstrated his skepticism. It was published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, Vol.43 No.5. Oâ€™Leary also went on the record and stated: I began to realize, just directly from the scientific point of view, not only hearsay, that this man was colluding with NASA, that there might be more to this than before. . . . Carl was on a committee with a number of notable people. There was a report issued by the Brookings Institution in 1961 â€” and thatâ€™s about when I knew Carl, during those years; the â€™60s mostly was when I worked closely with him â€” that he and this other group said: Well, if any ETs ever showed up on the Earth, it has to be covered up. Thatâ€™s the only way weâ€™re going to be able to manage this, because if we canâ€™t, then it would be too much of a culture shock. Quite a shocking statement from someone of Brianâ€™s stature, isnâ€™t it? In the interview, he goes on to say that Carl and his colleagues recommended that the governments cover up the UFO phenomenon, and that he believes this provided justification for the ongoing cover-up Itâ€™s important to note that this does not make Sagan a â€bad guy.â€™ He was clearly the opposite of that, and his love for science and educating humanity was quite clear. If he was in favour of covering this up, if he did know about it, there is a very good chance it was done for what they perceived to be, good reasons. Sure, there might be some corporate reasons, and some other not so pleasant reasons the cover-up remains today, but itâ€™s plausible to assume that in the beginning, perhaps there was no Iâ€™ll intent. â€œBehind the scenes, high ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.â€ Former head of CIA, Roscoe Hillenkoetter, 1960 (source) Why Itâ€™s Time To Listen To Contactees, Abductees & Experiences/ A Psychological Standpoint Just to clarify, â€contacteesâ€™ are usually those who have reported â€friendlyâ€™ contact experiences with extraterrestrials, â€abducteesâ€™ are those who have had what they perceive to be fearful experiences, and experiencers are those who neither view the experience as â€goodâ€™ or â€bad,â€ but simply just an experience. Itâ€™s important to note this, because various people have reported different types of experiences with different types of beings. â€œYes there have been crashed craft, and bodies recoveredâ€¦ We are not alone in the universe, they have been coming here for a long time.â€ â€“ Dr. Edgar Mitchell, ScD, 6th man to walk on the Moon ( source ) ( source ) The reality is that some people who claim to have had contact with intelligent extraterrestrial beings actually have. John Mack, A Harvard professor, psychiatrist and Pulitzer Price recipient stresses that: â€œYes, itâ€™s both. Itâ€™s both literally, physically happening to a degree; and itâ€™s also some kind of psychological, spiritual experience occurring and originating perhaps in another dimension. And so the phenomenon stretches us, or it asks us to stretch to open to realities that are not simply the literal physical world, but to extend to the possibility that there are other unseen realities from which our consciousness, our, if you will, learning processes over the past several hundred years have closed us off.â€ ( source ) We published an article earlier this year regarding John Mack, and more than 60 school children witnessing non-human beings and a large craft landing. The children were interviewed by him, and it was quite a remarkable story with all of the children providing very similiar stories. Until this day these children have been speaking of it, an event occurred more than 20 years agoâ€¦. â€œThey describe these events like a person talks about something that has happened to them. I can tell that these are people of sound mind telling me somethingâ€¦â€ (quote continued and taken from the video linked below) -Dr. John Mack, professor of psychiatry, Harvard Medical School You can watch THIS video of Mack Interview the children, and you can read THIS article that goes more into detail on that case. According to retired McGill University professor in the Department of Psychology (research areas beings cognition and cognitive Neuroscience), Dr. Don Donderi: â€œSome of what people report as UFOs are extraterrestrial (ET) vehicles. Some of those extraterrestrial vehicles actually have ET crews, and some of those ET crews catch and release humans.â€ ( source ) Academicians like these, and others like Richard Dolan , David M. Jacobs and more have been studying this phenomena for decades, and the reports of beings and examining why they are here, what they are doing, what they look like and more has been documented by their (and others) research. What I find most fascinating about these stories is how many of them seem to compliment each other instead of contradicting each other, which just adds to the mystery. As far as physical research goes: â€œThere are a great many photographs of such body marks, many of which are in an equilateral triangle pattern of red dots on the wrist or near the ankle. Also common are scoop marks,â€ in which it appears as if a small amount of tissue was removed from beneath the skin, leaving an indentation.â€ -Richard Dolan (taken from his book, UFOs for the 21st century mind ) Below is a clip of Dr. Roger Leir. a doctor of podiatric medicine, and arguably the best known individual with regards to extracting alleged alien implants. He has performed more than fifteen surgeries that removed sixteen separate distinct objects. These objects have been investigated by several prestigious laboratories, including Los Alamos National Laboratories, New Mexico Tech, and many others. Unfortunately, he passed away in March 2014, but his legacy lives on. 
Truth is, as former NASA astronaut and Princeton Physics Professor puts it, â€œthere is abundant evidence that we are being contacted, that civilizations have been visiting us for a vary long time.â€ ( source ) Interesting Quotes About The UFO Phenomenon (A Few Out Of Many) ***Please keep in mind, the documentation regarding this phenomenon can be found from links that were mentioned in the very first paragraph of this article â€ Everything is in a process of investigation both in the United States and in Spain, as well as the rest of the world. The nations of the world are currently working together in the investigation of the UFO phenomenon. There is an international exchange of data.â€ â€“ General Carlos Castro Cavero (1979). From â€œUFOs and the National Security State, Volume 2,â€³ written by Richard Dolan. â€œThere is a serious possibility that we are being visited and have been visited for many years by people from outer space, by other civilizations. Who they are, where they are from, and what they want should be the subject of rigorous scientific investigation and not be the subject of â€rubishingâ€™ by tabloid newspapers.â€ ( source ) â€“ Lord Admiral Hill-Norton, Former Chief of Defence Staff, 5 Star Admiral of the Royal Navy, Chairman of the NATO Military Committee â€œThere is another way whether itâ€™s wormholes or warping space, thereâ€™s got to be a way to generate energy so that you can pull it out of the vacuum, and the fact that theyâ€™re here shows us that they found a way.â€ ( source ) â€“ Jack Kasher, Ph.D, Professor Emeritus of physics, University of Nebraska. â€œThis thing has gotten so highly-classifiedâ€¦ it is just impossible to get anything on it. I have no idea who controls the flow of need-to-know because, frankly, I was told in such an emphatic way that it was none of my business that Iâ€™ve never tried to make it to be my business since. I have been interested in this subject for a long time and I do know that whatever the Air Force has on the subject is going to remain highly classified.â€ â€“ Senator Barry Goldwater, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee (source) â€œYes, itâ€™s both. Itâ€™s both literally, physically happening to a degree; and itâ€™s also some kind of psychological, spiritual experience occurring and originating perhaps in another dimension. And so the phenomenon stretches us, or it asks us to stretch to open to realities that are not simply the literal physical world, but to extend to the possibility that there are other unseen realities from which our consciousness, our, if you will, learning processes over the past several hundred years have closed us off.â€ â€“ John Mack,Dr. John E. Mack, a Harvard University psychologist and Pulitzer prize winnerâ€ ( source ) â€œAn extraterrestrial influence is investigating our planet. Something is monitoring the planet and they are monitoring it very cautiously.â€ â€” 2008 Presidential Candidate Mike Gravel ( source )( source ) â€œSome of what people report as UFOs are extraterrestrial (ET) vehicles. Some of those extraterrestrial vehicles actually have ET crews, and some of those ET crews catch and release humans.â€ â€” Dr. Don Donderi, a retired McGill University Professor of 40 years in the Department of Psychology ( source ) â€œIntelligent beings from other star systems have been and are visiting our planet Earth. They are variously referred to as Visitors, Others, Star People, Etâ€™s, etcâ€¦They are visiting Earth now; this is not a matter of conjecture or wistful thinking. â€“ Theodor C. Loder III, Phd, Professor Emeritus of Earth Sciences, University of New Hampshire ( source ) â€œDecades ago, visitors from other plants warned us about where we were headed and offered to help. But instead, we, or at least some of us, interpreted their visits as a threat, and decided to shoot first and ask questions after.â€ â€“ Paul Hellyer, Former Canadian Defense Minister ( source ) My people tell of Star People who came to us many generations ago. The Star people brought spiritual teachings and stories and maps of the cosmos and they offered these freely. They were kind, loving, and set a great example. When they left us, my people say there was a loneliness like no other.â€ â€“ Richard Wagamese , Ojibway Author ( source ) Iâ€™m skeptical about many things, including the notion that government always knows best, and that the people canâ€™t be trusted with the truth. The time to pull the curtain back on this subject is long overdue. We have statements from the most credible sources â€“ those in a position to know â€“ about a fascinating phenomenon, the nature of which is yet to be determined. John Podesta, for example â€” former White House Chief of Staff for Bill Clinton, Barack Obamaâ€™s right hand man (councillor), and the current head of Hilary Clintonâ€™s presidential campaign,Taken from Leslie Keanâ€™s 2010 New York Times bestseller, UFOs: Generals, Pilots, And Government Officials Go On The Record, in which Podesta wrote the forward â€œYes there have been crashed craft, and bodies recoveredâ€¦ We are not alone in the universe, they have been coming here for a long timeâ€¦I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet, and the UFO phenomenon is real.â€ â€“ Doctor Edgar Mitchell, 6th man to walk on the moon( source ) ( source )( source)
