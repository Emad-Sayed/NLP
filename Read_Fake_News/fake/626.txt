'Racist and sexistâ€™ complaints against Aussie lamb advert rejected   18:36 Get short URL The ad recieves complaints of being sexist and racist against white men. © We love our Lamb / YouTube The Advertising Standards Board of Australia (ASB) has rejected complaints that an advertisement for lamb is offensive to white males. Several complaints were lodged about the ad which producers say attempts to be all-inclusive with the people it features. 
Produced by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), the ad titled â€œYou Never Lamb Aloneâ€ features a white TV presenter quickly being switched with a Bengali-Australian actor Arka Das who introduces a range of ethnicities and sexual orientations as he moves towards a barbeque cooking lamb - â€œthe meat that doesnâ€™t discriminateâ€.

Most of the complaints to the Advertising Standards Board of Australia centered on the opening switch of white TV presenter Luke Jacobz to Das, after Jacobz utters the line â€œIâ€™m here to address concerns that too many perky white males are contributing to the lack of diversity on our screens.â€

â€œThis advertisement clearly states â€too many WHITE peopleâ€™ in its commercial which is highly offensive,â€ one complaint read, according to Bandt . â€œPointing out someoneâ€™s race and gender in an advertisement and then denigrating such race or gender is both racist and sexist,â€ another read. To whoever wrote this lamb ad, thank you for all the tongue-in-cheek jokes about 'diversity' in Australia. https://t.co/E87jCXMFr3 â€” she stress@pax prep (@ChattyAnny) October 26, 2016 
MLA explained that the line was â€œsimply a nod to the common criticism that Australian television lacks diversity,â€ with the ASB rejecting the complaints on similar grounds. Well done MEAT & LIVESTOCK AUSTRALIA for â€œYouâ€™ll never lamb aloneâ€ winning the Marketing Communications: B2C and B2B award. #AMI #AMIAwards 
â€œThe Board considered that the advertisement did not portray or depict material in a way which discriminates against or vilifies a person or section of the community on account of race or gender,â€ they said.
