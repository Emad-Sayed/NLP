PENNSYLVANIA GUN STORE tells customers â€œMuslims and Hillary supporters are not welcomeâ€ An advertisement for ALTRA FIREARMS warns potential customers that Muslims and supporters of Hillary Clinton, who are â€œterroristsâ€ in the storeâ€™s parlance, are not welcome. ¢€œPlease NO Muslims or Hillary Supporters ¢€” We do not feel safe selling to terrorists!¢€ Altra Firearms in Jackson Center, Pennsylvania advertised in local papers this week.‚ TalkingPointsMemo ‚ The ¢€œPolitically Incorrect Firearms¢€ store also invited readers to ¢€œVisit our underground bunker and speak with our unique and deplorable sales associates.¢€ Altra Firearmsâ€™ owner Paul Chandler, 54, told TPM Friday that he¢€™s had a sign in front of his store advertising that supporters of President Obama aren¢€™t welcome to come inside, either. ¢€œWe did have, in three-foot letters, ¢€No radical Muslims,¢€™ but I changed that to ¢€No Muslims,¢€™ period,¢€ Chandler said in a phone interview, noting rhetoric from Iranian television motivated the change. ¢€œThey¢€™re saying that America is the great Satan and it¢€™s got to be destroyed. They¢€™re basically teaching that if it¢€™s an infidel, either they convert or kill them. And that¢€™s what they¢€™re doing in our country now,¢€ he said, comparing the actions of modern Islamic nations to the expansion of Muslim influence into Europe before the Crusades.‚ ¢€œIf the gun store in Florida wouldn¢€™t have sold to that man, there¢€™s be 40 or 50 more people alive,¢€ he continued, referring to Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in Orlando when he opened fire in an LGBT nightclub.‚ PA gun store ad: "please no Muslims or Hillary supporters.

â€” Dorey Scheimer (@DoreyScheimer) October 27, 2016 Chandler told TPM heâ€™s never actually denied service to any Muslims or Clinton supporters, although he said heâ€™d told one woman with an Obama bumper sticker on her car that the store was closed. He also said heâ€™d denied service to one man who told him ¢€œI hate niggers, I want a gun.¢€‚ Chandler said he didn¢€™t extend the same blanket ban to potential Christian customers after a series of abortion clinic bombings years ago because ¢€œhundreds of Christian preachers got up and said ¢€that is wrong.¢€™â€ ¢€œDo you hear any Muslim clerics condemning what is going on today?¢€ he asked. ¢€œI haven¢€™t heard one.¢€ In 2015, designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) sued a different store in Florida ( FLORIDA GUN SUPPLY ) which declared itself a â€Muslim Free Zoneâ€™ but the case was dismissed.
