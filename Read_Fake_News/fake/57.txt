Russia did hack the Democrats. So all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the U.S. election. 
But FBI Director James Comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the FBI investigated Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election, and so he told the Obama administration not to accuse Russia of the DNC hackings lest they be seen as â€œpartisanâ€. 
Republican FBI Director James Comey advised the Obama administration not to publicly accuse Russia of hacking the DNC and more â€œon the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the Nov. 8 election,â€ officials â€œfamiliar with the deliberationsâ€ told the Washington Post. 
These sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the Post on the condition of anonymity. 
There are a few reasons why Comey might want to keep his agencyâ€™s investigation of Russian interference under the radar, but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be re-opening its exhaustive investigation of Clintonâ€™s emails, which resulted from a Republican-led, bogus, overreaching and seemingly endless Benghazi investigation that also cleared Clinton, it seems odd that Comey was going to stay silent on the Russia matter. 
Comeyâ€™s decisions is especially odd given the reports that the Russians have been communicating and coordinating with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to the point that he is already â€œcompromised.â€ 
Only one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the United States president. 
The same sources tell the Post that Comey made the decision to reveal the Clinton emails to Congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed, which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation. 
Not sure Iâ€™m buying that because if Comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldnâ€™t have said anything at all, but that doesnâ€™t mean that his motives were nefarious. 
There might well be good reason for this â€“ after all, this is the FBI and they canâ€™t tell us everything, but as of right now Comey has mishandled this `and appears to be trying to influence an election to help Republicans. Just because he is a Republican and just because he has donated to Republicans doesnâ€™t mean he isnâ€™t doing his job properly. 
But Comey has a lot of explaining to do right now. He is under fire for good reason, as the explanations heâ€™s giving for these decisions donâ€™t make sense and are contradictory.
