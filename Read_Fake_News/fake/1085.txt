WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” A review of FBI Director James Comeyâ€™s professional history and relationships shows that the Obama cabinet leader â€” now under fire for his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton â€” is deeply entrenched in the big-money cronyism culture of Washington, D.C. His personal and professional relationships â€” all undisclosed as he announced the Bureau would not prosecute Clinton â€” reinforce bipartisan concerns that he may have politicized the criminal probe. 
These concerns focus on millions of dollars that Comey accepted from a Clinton Foundation defense contractor, Comeyâ€™s former membership on a Clinton Foundation corporate partnerâ€™s board, and his surprising financial relationship with his brother Peter Comey, who works at the law firm that does the Clinton Foundationâ€™s taxes. 
Lockheed Martin 
When President Obama nominated Comey to become FBI director in 2013, Comey promised the United States Senate that he would recuse himself on all cases involving former employers. 
But Comey earned $6 million in one year alone from Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin became a Clinton Foundation donor that very year. 
Comey served as deputy attorney general under John Ashcroft for two years of the Bush administration. When he left the Bush administration, he went directly to Lockheed Martin and became vice president, acting as a general counsel . 
How much money did James Comey make from Lockheed Martin in his last year with the company, which he left in 2010? More than $6 million in compensation . 
Lockheed Martin is a Clinton Foundation donor . The company admitted to becoming a Clinton Global Initiative member in 2010. 
According to records , Lockheed Martin is also a member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, which paid Bill Clinton $250,000 to deliver a speech in 2010 . 
In 2010 , Lockheed Martin won 17 approvals for private contracts from the Hillary Clinton State Department. 
HSBC Holdings 
In 2013, Comey became a board member, a director, and a Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee member of the London bank HSBC Holdings. 
â€œMr. Comeyâ€™s appointment will be for an initial three-year term which, subject to re-election by shareholders, will expire at the conclusion of the 2016 Annual General Meeting,â€ according to HSBC company records . 
HSBC Holdings and its various philanthropic branches routinely partner with the Clinton Foundation . For instance, HSBC Holdings has partnered with Deutsche Bank through the Clinton Foundation to â€œretrofit 1,500 to 2,500 housing units, primarily in the low- to moderate-income sectorâ€ in â€œNew York City.â€ 
â€œRetrofittingâ€ refers to a Green initiative to conserve energy in commercial housing units. Clinton Foundation records show that the Foundation projected â€œ $1 billion in financing â€ for this Green initiative to conserve peopleâ€™s energy in low-income housing units.
