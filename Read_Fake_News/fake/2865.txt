Dead Coloradans are Lining Up to Vote for Hillary. Is the zombie apocalypse upon us? 
According to a report by the Washington Examiner , 
Local officials in Colorado acknowledged â€œvery seriousâ€ voter fraud after learning of votes cast in multiple elections under the named of recently-deceased residents. 
A local media outlet uncovered the fraud by comparing voting history databases in the state with federal government death records . â€œSomebody was able to cast a vote that was not theirs to cast,â€ El Paso County Clerk and Recorder Chuck Broerman told CBS4 while discussing what he called a â€œvery seriousâ€ pattern of people mailing in ballots on behalf of the dead. 
Itâ€™s not clear how many fraudulent ballots have been submitted in recent years. CBS4 reported that it â€œfound multiple casesâ€ of dead people voting around the state, revelations that have provoked state criminal investigations. 
There are dozens of documented examples of dead people voting and they can be found all over the internet. 
One thing is for certain. 
The Clinton operatives seem to believe in the old adageâ€¦ if you ainâ€™t cheatinâ€™ you ainâ€™t tryinâ€™â€¦ On October 1st it was reported â€œYoung Virginia Democrat Andrew Spieles confessed this week to registering 19 dead people to vote for Hillary.â€ 
You canâ€™t stop these people. You can call the election rigged if you want, but how can we argue with people who have the power to summon the dead? 
When I die, I plan to vote conservative. 
OK, my attempts to be humorous are often lost in an overcrowded sea of stupidity. This would not seem to be the exception. 
The only good Hillary voters are obviously the dead ones , because at least they have plausible deniability. Hey bro, â€œ I didnâ€™t vote for Hillary â€” I died in 1960. â€ 
Likely story.
