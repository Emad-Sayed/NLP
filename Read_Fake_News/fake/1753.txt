Donâ€™t CLICK that, stupid! Is this email from March 2016 how â€hackersâ€™ accessed #PodestaEmails21 and others? Posted at 11:22 am on October 28, 2016 by Sam J. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter

Dear John and other people who have been living under a rock, Google wouldnâ€™t send you an email called, â€œSomeone has your password.â€ Likely it would be a message about a possible breach or some urgency about changing your password but they wouldnâ€™t send you something like this. 
And never, EVER EVER EVER click a link in an email, especially if itâ€™s one you donâ€™t recognize. Okay â€“ is this a copy of the phishing email to Podesta on March 19? pic.twitter.com/1jqUvafUpk

A bit.ly link for you to click to change your password. 
John, donâ€™t be stupid. 
Couldnâ€™t someone in Homeland Security or the NSA or one of those other fancy Federal agencies have taken some time to tell these people the doâ€™s and donâ€™t of being online? *smh* @jamiedupree Actually, wait, I didn't see the bit.ly link. (and I ain't gonna fire it up to see!) Could be the phish, yeah. 
Typically most people are apprehensive to click a bit.ly link from someone they KNOW, let alone some odd email from Google telling you someone has your password. Trending It's official, she's NUTS! Donna Brazile thinks Democrats can turn THIS state blue (hint: no way in Hell) 
*donâ€™t click it* @jamiedupree That's likely itâ€¦ check out where the bitly link goes: https://t.co/yKjaZzCxo9 (Chrome warns the site is malicious.) pic.twitter.com/7WACDWQwfS

Yikes. Shocked Kyle clicked it â€¦ hope he didnâ€™t have anything signed in or important in that browser or app. @jamiedupree Most definitely. For many reasons. One being that google does not use @Bitly

Surely Podesta is like, â€œNOW YOU TELL ME.â€ 
Heh. @jamiedupree Looks like 'that sort of thing',However,
