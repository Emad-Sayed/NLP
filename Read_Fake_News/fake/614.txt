  Bill Clinton is a sex-addicted â€monsterâ€™ who mocked Hillary Clinton by calling her â€The Wardenâ€™ in front of friends and privately boasted about his high notch count, according to his long-time mistress and childhood friend Dolly Kyle. Kyle, now 68, says she had a decades-long affair with   before and during his marriage and had a front-row seat to Billâ€™s salacious double-life in the 1970s and â€™80s. Their on-again, off-again relationship ended abruptly in the 1990s, after Bill Clinton allegedly threatened to â€destroyâ€™ Kyle if she spoke to the media about their relationship. Kyleâ€™s decades of observations, shared in an interview with the DailyMail.com as well as in her 2016 book The Other Woman, provide a unique perspective on the Clintonsâ€™ marriage and the coupleâ€™s treatment of the women who have accused   of infidelity or sexual assault over the years. Kyle, an Arkansas native who has since befriended several of Bill Clintonâ€™s sexual assault accusers, said she was determined to come forward with her story after hearing Hillary Clinton say on the campaign trail that women who have been sexually assaulted have the â€right to be believedâ€™.  35
