Proof God is on Duterteâ€™s Side! 
Azzmador October 29, 2016 God gave this man three missions: Kill drug dealers â€“ stop cussing â€“ gas kikes! 
These days itâ€™s not very often a nation can say their leader has the approval of the Almighty God himself, but now, the Philippines can claim this distinction. 
The Washington Post : 
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has made a solemn promise: no more swearing. 
Duterte, who famously cursed the pope and used a slang term that translates as ¢€œ son of a whore â€ while denouncing President Obama, said he was flying back from Japan late Thursday, looking at a vast expanse of sky, listening to his colleagues snore, when he heard a voice say, ¢€œIf you don¢€™t stop epithets, I will bring this plane down now.¢€ 
I know many of you may be skeptical of his claim, but not me. Iâ€™ve heard people claim they spoke to God many times in my life, and until now, there was always some personal agenda involved. When I was a kid, I had relatives tell me God wanted me to have a crew cut. Then there were the more famous situations like Oral Roberts saying that if his flock didnâ€™t send him ten million dollars by a specified date, God would kill him, personally. 
Then you had guys like Ted Haggard. Iâ€™m pretty sure God told him it wasnâ€™t a good idea to be snorting meth off the units of male prostitutes while he was the pastor of an evangelical megachurch and spiritual advisor to the likes of George W. Bush, but if so, Godâ€™s words went unheeded. 
Not so with the infamous Flip shitlord. 
¢€œAnd I said, ¢€Who is this?¢€™ So, of course, ¢€it¢€™s God,¢€™¢€ he told Filipino journalists late Thursday. 
¢€œSo, I promise God,¢€ he continued, ¢€œNot [to] express slang, cuss words and everything. So you guys hear me right always because [a] promise to God is a promise to the Filipino people.¢€ Godâ€™s servant on Earth, Rodrigo Duterte, contemplating the sound of one hand killing all the drug lords. 
Now thereâ€™s a man with his priorities straight. He identifies the speaker, and makes his promise, publicly, to God and his people, that he will obey. Of course, all fascists believe in a natural hierarchy, so his obedience just makes sense. 
An important thing to note is, when God speaks, what he doesnâ€™t say is just as important as what he said. He told Duterte, â€œstop cussing.â€ Nothing more. 
Thank goodness he did not say â€œstop killing criminals.â€ I was pretty sure he wouldnâ€™t, but you never know. What a reliefâ€¦ 
Of course, not everyone is theologically adept, i.e. the author of the WaPo article. She took to Twitter to make some heretical and thoroughly unfair remarks. Err, to quote @astroehlein , "Did God mention the death squads?" https://t.co/QezjfCweEH

No Emily, God did not mention the death squads, and any true believer knows this means he approves of them. 
Where in the Holy Bible does it say youâ€™re supposed to allow savage drug kingpins to wage war in your streets, killing innocents by the thousands, just so they can decide who gets to sell poison to your people and in what location? Iâ€™ve never read that part. 
I cannot confirm whether or not Emily Rauhala is a Jew, but sheâ€™s WaPoâ€™s â€œChina Correspondent,â€ and her Twitter timeline reads like someone with a personal vendetta against the fantastic leader of The Philippines. 
Whatever her problem is, sheâ€™d better get a handle on it, because in ten days weâ€™re electing a Great Christian here as well!
