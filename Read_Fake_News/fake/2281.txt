Leading Republican presidential hopeful suggests Israeli-Palestinian peace accord may be impossible: â€Sometimes agreements canâ€™t be madeâ€™After being asked by a voter at a Charleston, South Carolina, town hall event hosted by MSNBC about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict, the GOP contender vowed to give it â€œone hell of a shotâ€ and called it â€œprobably the toughest agreement of any kind to make.â€But when pressed by host Joe Scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either Israelis or Palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord, Trump declined to take sides. 
â€œYou know, I donâ€™t want to get into it, because â€¦ If I win, I donâ€™t want to be in a position where Iâ€™m saying to you and the other side now says, â€We donâ€™t want Trump involved,'â€ Trump said. 
â€œLet me be sort of a neutral guy,â€ he continued. â€œA lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal. So I donâ€™t want to say whose fault is it. I donâ€™t think it helps.â€Trump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a two-state solution, given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time. 
â€œItâ€™s possible itâ€™s not makeable, because donâ€™t forget it has to last â€” itâ€™s wonderful to make it and it doesnâ€™t work, but it has to last,â€ he said. â€œTo make lasting peace there? Probably the toughest deal of all, but Iâ€™m going to give it a shot.â€ 
Though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement, he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate, and what he considers the root of the conflict. 
â€œA lot of people say an agreement canâ€™t be made, which is okay. I mean, sometimes agreements canâ€™t be made. Not good, but, you know, you have both sides really, but one side in particular, growing up and learning that these are the worst people,â€ he said. â€œI was with a very prominent Israeli the other day. He says itâ€™s impossible, because the other side has been trained from the time theyâ€™re children to hate Jewish people.â€In the past, Trump has questioned Israelâ€™s commitment to peace, while at the same time suggesting the Jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the Palestinians. He has also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu â€œa good friend.â€ 
At a presidential candidates forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, the real estate magnate said, â€œI donâ€™t know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I donâ€™t know that the other side has the commitment to make it.â€ 
He made the same point in an interview with AP earlier that day: â€œA lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal â€” whether or not Israelâ€™s willing to sacrifice certain things,â€ he said. â€œThey may not be, and I understand that, and Iâ€™m okay with that. But then youâ€™re just not going to have a deal.â€ 
Trumpâ€™s comments Wednesday came hours after a dramatic upset in polls saw Trump fall behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the first time in 31 consecutive polls, coming in at 26% of registered Republican voters nationally, two points behind Cruz at 28%.
