A woman in Hollywood, Maryland is the latest in a number of early voters to claim that her ballot was switched to Hillary Clinton after she had tried to vote for Donald Trump. Maryland Trump Supporter: They Switched My Vote to Hillary â€“ https://t.co/FkNiEUOZHH pic.twitter.com/dalY9KBWtj 
â€” Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) October 28, 2016 Noting that she had seen reports on the news of votes being flipped, the woman said, â€œI went in and voted a straight Republican ticket and thank God I went back and checked and they had switched my vote from Trump to (Hillary).â€ She said that she had to get the vote changed back by alerting election officials, who simply told her to vote for a second time. â€œI went back the second time and made sure they didnâ€™t change it,â€ she concluded. As we reported earlier this week, voters in numerous areas of Texas have made a series of complaints that votes are being switched from Trump to Clinton . One election official responded by claiming the problems were caused by voters not understanding how to use the machines properly. â€œTypically, weâ€™ve found itâ€™s voter error with the equipment,â€ Frank Phillips, Tarrant Countyâ€™s election administrator, told WFAA . â€œSometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates â€¦ or do something with the wheelâ€¦.There is not an issue with the equipment.â€ However, Trump supporters continue to point to the reports as evidence that vote fraud may be taking place.
