I am not privy, of course, to the inner workings of Hillary Clintonâ€™s world. In fact, very few people are, considering that Clinton isnâ€™t exactly ruler of the Principality of Transparencyland. However, given her history, I find that itâ€™s usually safe to assume the worst when it comes to her. 
Itâ€™s not that weâ€™ve been lied to yet again. If I got angry every time Hillary Clinton lied to us, my blood pressure could run a hydroelectric power plant. Itâ€™s that she lied so cravenly about an issue that affects our national security .
