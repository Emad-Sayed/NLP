Nanny In Jail After Force Feeding Baby To Death 2 shares by Ike Mclean / October 27, 2016 / LIFE / 
Oluremi Oyindasola, 66, of Glenarden, Maryland has been charged with second-degree murder, first-degree child abuse resulting in death and other offenses, after she force fed an eight-month-old baby girl who then died. 
Home surveillance footage shows Oyindasola was napping when the eight-month-old child began crying and approached the nanny in a toddler walker. 
Police say Oyindasola then tried to feed the child, and when her attempt was unsuccessful, she â€œproceeded to pour a large amount of white liquid directly inside the victimâ€™s mouth.â€ 
Col. Harry Bond with Prince Georgeâ€™s County Police told NBC Washington Oyindasola â€œforcefully poured the two bottles of what looks to be milk down the babyâ€™s mouth, causing her to not be able to breathe, suffocating her, and eventually she died at the hospital.â€ 
In a news release Prince Georgeâ€™s County Police said the following: 
â€œOn October 24th, at about 4.10pm, the baby had been rushed to a hospital after she became unresponsive at home. 
â€œShe was pronounced dead a short time later. An autopsy on Tuesday revealed the babyâ€™s cause of death was asphyxiation. The manner of death was ruled a homicide.â€ 
â€œThe preliminary investigation revealed the injuries to the baby occurred while in the sole care and custody of Oyindasola.â€ 
Oyindasol is currently in police custody and is being held on $1 million bond.
