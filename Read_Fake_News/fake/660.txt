Retired assistant FBI director James Kallstrom made history this week when he publicly endorsed Donald Trump for president. According to the Conservative Post , never before has an FBI director endorsed a presidential candidate. 
â€œIâ€™m endorsing Donald Trump,â€ Kallstrom said on Fox News. â€œIâ€™ve known him 40 years. Iâ€™ve never endorsed a candidate. Heâ€™s a good human being. Heâ€™s a generous person. Heâ€™s got a big heart. Heâ€™s done hundreds and hundreds of things for people without fanfare.â€ 
â€œHeâ€™s a good guy. Heâ€™s a patriot of this country and regardless of what he says, his acts show that he is not that person. Heâ€™s been in this Hollywood crowd that talks like that, a lot of people talk like that,â€ he continued, in reference to the leaked audio tape from 2005 in which Trump made lewd comments about women. 
â€œHe doesnâ€™t do these things. Heâ€™s a good guy. Iâ€™ve known his family from the time they were kids. Look at his children. Could you find a better family than he brought up in this country? This country is absolutely going in the wrong direction.â€ 
â€œSeventy percent of the people want change,â€ Kallstrom added, as reported by CP . â€œYouâ€™re not going to get change with Hillary Clinton. This is the woman that lied when she was on the Watergate staff. I mean, sheâ€™s a pathological liar.â€
