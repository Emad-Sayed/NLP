Following on from her recent piece for Time magazine , in which she so eloquently explained why America is indispensable and exceptional, TheBlogMire brings you an exclusive piece in which Mrs Clinton explains why an indispensable and exceptional nation must have an indispensable and exceptional leader. 
(Warning: May contain traces of satire) 
If thereâ€™s one core belief that has guided and inspired me every step of my career in public service, itâ€™s this: I am an exceptional woman. A great, unselfish, compassionate woman, to paraphrase Robert Kennedy. And when you add up all my advantages, itâ€™s clear Iâ€™m indispensable too â€“ someone all others can look to for leadership. 
And what Iâ€™m really excited about is not just that Iâ€™m indispensable, but that Iâ€™m about to become President of the indispensable nation. An indispensable nation needs an indispensable woman. An indispensable woman needs an indispensable nation. Itâ€™s a match made in heaven, which is why I am asking you to help me break the glass ceiling on November 8th â€“ so that together we can become even more exceptional than we already are. 
So what makes me so indispensable? 
Iâ€™m indispensable in part because of my love for our armed forces. Our military is the greatest in history, with the best troops, training and technology, and I believe it is a travesty that we are not using it to its full potential. Itâ€™s essential we do everything we can to support our men and women in uniform, and I intend to do just that by sending our brave soldiers on important missions around the globe from day one of my presidency. 
Iâ€™m indispensable because of my commitment to the truth. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve always sought to stay close to the truth. I know that thereâ€™s a lot of folks out there who say Iâ€™m corrupt. But those who know me closest will tell you that this isnâ€™t the real Hillary. Ask those who know me best. Ask my husband Bill. Heâ€™ll tell you. Ask my campaign chairman John Podesta. Heâ€™ll tell you. Ask Lloyd Blankfein, CEO at Goldman Sachs. Heâ€™ll tell you. Ask some of our closest allies in places like Saudi Arabia. Theyâ€™ll tell you. They will all tell you about the real Hillary, and that my commitment to honesty and fighting corruption is second to none. It may even be my most exceptional quality. Alongside humility. 
Iâ€™m also indispensable because of my network of alliances and supporters. You only have to look at who they are. Has there ever been a candidate in the entire history of our exceptional nation that has managed to get the backing of the entire media and corporate America? I donâ€™t think so. But it does tell you something, doesnâ€™t it? I humbly submit that it speaks volumes that some of the most important people in our exceptional country are prepared to place their trust in me. 
Iâ€™m indispensable because, unlike Donald Trump, I donâ€™t need to rely on the help of people like Vladimir Putin and countries like Russia to help get me elected. Can you imagine me having to rely on Putin and Russia to get elected? Of course Iâ€™ve had to bring Putin and Russia up in this campaign from time to time, not because I want to keep bringing Putin and Russia into it. In fact, the only reason Iâ€™ve occasionally mentioned Putin and Russia is not because I want to keep talking about Putin and Russia, but because I have to keep taking about Putin and Russia because Trump is depending on Putin and Russia to get him elected and so I have to draw attention to Putin and Russia. But trust me, if I had my way I wouldnâ€™t bring Putin and Russia up at all. 
Iâ€™m indispensable because of my commitment to helping countries get rid of their dictators, and establishing democracy and peace. Like Libya, for example. We came. We saw. He died. And the Libyans got their liberty. 
Most of all, Iâ€™m ­indispensable â€” and exceptional â€” because of my values. 
Take my commitment to human rights, which I have shown by being one of the most vocal supporters of a womanâ€™s right to terminate her pregnancy, right up to a few seconds before the thing inside her becomes a human. 
Take my commitment to raising money, which my husband and I have shown through our tireless work with the Clinton Foundation, and in making hundreds of speeches for various organisations. 
Take my commitment to making the world a better place, which Iâ€™ve shown time and time again by saying things like â€œlove trumps hateâ€. Which it does, doesnâ€™t it? Iâ€™m proud of that expression. 
But with all of these advantages comes ­responsibility â€“ I need to lead the world. You need me to lead the world. Because if I fail to lead, I will leave a vacuum that lets extremists, Putin and Russia, haters, bigots, the intolerant, Putin and Russia, the severely backwards , the Julian Assangeâ€™s of this world,Putin and Russia â€“ Baskets of Deplorables â€“ take root everywhere. 
Of course, being exceptional doesnâ€™t mean that other people donâ€™t also have something to offer â€” maybe they do. But I have an unparalleled ability to be a force for peace, progress and prosperity around the world, which I intend to demonstrate on day one of my presidency, by standing up to Putin and Russia and showing Putin and Russia whoâ€™s boss. 
Iâ€™ll never stop doing good. Never. Thatâ€™s what makes me great. Iâ€™m good because Iâ€™m great, and Iâ€™ll tell you one thing, Iâ€™ll never stop. 
Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m indispensable. 
Letâ€™s keep me exceptional. Did you enjoy this article? - Consider helping us! Russia Insider depends on your donations: the more you give, the more we can do. $1 $10 Other amount
