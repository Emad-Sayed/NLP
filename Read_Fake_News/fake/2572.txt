Speaker At Trump Rally Says He Hopes Hillary Clinton Dies In A Fiery Car Crash (VIDEO) By Andrew Bradford on October 30, 2016 Subscribe 
When historians write accounts of the 2016 race for the White House, itâ€™s very likely that one of the things which will get special attention is the level of violenceâ€“both physical and verbalâ€“which has emanated from those who slavishly support GOP nominee Donald Trump. 
If you doubt this fact, consider what was said earlier today at a Trump rally being held in Las Vegas. Author and self-described â€œcapitalist evangelistâ€ Wayne Allyn Root was giving a rambling speech as a warm-up before Der Fuhrer Donald took the stage, and while portions of it were comparable to the rantings of Charles Manson after too much caffeine, it was the language Root used (highly militaristic and warlike) that you cannot help but notice. At various points in his unhinged diatribe, Root used the following phrases : â€œTrump warriorsâ€ â€œTrump armyâ€ â€œTrump revolutionâ€ 
Then, in full psychotic rant, Root attempted to mix together plot elements from the O.J. Simpson case with the movies Driving Miss Daisy and Thelma and Louise , telling the ecstatic crowd : â€œItâ€™s Hillary in a White Ford Bronco. Sheâ€™s got Huma driving and theyâ€™re headed for the Mexican border. I have a name for the future TV movie. Itâ€™s called Driving Miss Hillary. And the ending, if we all get our wish, is like Thelma and Louise!â€ 
Finally, Root ended his echo of Nuremberg by declaring: â€œI will give you my country when you pry it from my cold dead hands.â€ 
When I listen to Wayne Allyn Root (or any of the other fanatical Trumpkins), the movie that comes to mind for me is One Flew Over the Cuckooâ€™s Nest.
