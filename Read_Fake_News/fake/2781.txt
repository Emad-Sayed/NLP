Illinois Senator Draws Fire for Racially Charged Attack on Opponentâ€™s Family Alexandra Jaffe and Traci G. Lee, NBC News, October 28, 2016 
Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk is again under fire for making racially-charged comments, this time for questioning the military service of his Democratic opponentâ€™s family. 
During Thursday nightâ€™s debate between Kirk and challenger Rep. Tammy Duckworth, Duckworth spoke about her desire to be in the Senate as a voice of reason and referenced her familyâ€™s history of service, saying, â€œMy family has served this nation in uniform, going back to the Revolution. Iâ€™m a daughter of the American Revolution. Iâ€™ve bled for this nation. But I still want to be there in the Senate when the drums of war sound. Because people are quick to sound the drums of war, and I want to be there to say this is what it costs, this is what youâ€™re asking us to do. . . . Families like mine are the ones that bleed first.â€ 
Kirk responded: â€œI had forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.â€ Tammy Duckworth is a vet who lost both legs in Iraq. Her family has served since the Revolutionary War. And yetâ€¦ pic.twitter.com/DHd3kWrUsN

Though Duckworth, who was born in Thailand to a Thai mother of Chinese descent and an American father, did not respond on the stage, she tweeted a photo after the debate of herself with her parentsâ€“her father displaying medals of service on his coat. â€œMy mom is an immigrant and my dad and his family have served this nation in uniform since the Revolution,â€ Duckworth wrote. 
Duckworthâ€™s late father, Franklin, served in World War II and has â€œtraced his lineage back to an ancestor who fought in the American Revolution,â€ according to a 2012 Mother Jones profile on Duckworthâ€™s run for Congress.

On Friday, Kirk tried to tamp down the backlash and tweeted â€œsincere apologies to an American hero.â€ 
Itâ€™s not the first time the Illinois senator has courted controversy with racially-charged commentsâ€“he previously said President Obama was â€œacting like the drug dealer in chiefâ€ for the administrationâ€™s cash payment to Iran in exchange for the release of American prisoners, and talked about fostering opportunities for African-American entrepreneurs so â€œthat the black community is not the one we drive faster through.â€
