The FBI has learned of more emails involving Hillary Clintonâ€™s private email server while she headed the State Department, FBI Director James Comey told several members of Congress, telling them he is reopening the investigation. â€œIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of email that appear to be pertinentâ€ to Clintonâ€™s investigation, Comey wrote to the chairs of several relevant congressional committees, adding that he was briefed about the messages on Thursday. â€œI agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.â€

The FBI director cautioned, however, that the bureau has yet to assess the importance of the material, and that he doesnâ€™t know how long that will take.
FBI Dir just informed me, "The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation." Case reopened

Stocks fell after Comeyâ€™s announcement, CNBC reported.
Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the decision to reopen the case.
â€œNow that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness,â€ he said in a statement. â€œThe American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law.â€ 
Almost 15,000 new Clinton emails were discovered in September.

In mid-October, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, promised at least â€œfour new hearingsâ€ after Congress returns from recess in November based on the new emails, which lawmakers received but have not been made public.
â€œThis is a flashing red light of potential criminality,â€ Chaffetz said.
The new evidence points to a â€œquid pro quoâ€ arrangement between the FBI and the State Department, he noted.
