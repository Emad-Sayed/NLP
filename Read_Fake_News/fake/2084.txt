At a prestigious Boston school, they have a pretty strict dress code. No gang-related colors, no cut-offs, nothing too offensive or revealing. 
Women at Boston Latin School canâ€™t wear skirts whose hemlines are more than four inches above the knee and their bra straps canâ€™t be the â€œspaghettiâ€ style, where theyâ€™re so thin theyâ€™re barely there. This is a middle and high school folks â€¦ not a college for adults. 
Itâ€™s a way of showing a little decorum â€“ a little respect for yourself and for the school. 
And it promotes rape culture . 
Because for radical feminists, telling them not to dress provocatively is telling them that men are sexist pigs who simply canâ€™t resist the wiles of a woman. 
They call it â€œvictim-blamingâ€ and while thereâ€™s a point to it â€“ you canâ€™t blame a woman for being assault if sheâ€™s jogging alone in a park, but certainly you can bring up a womanâ€™s attire if it is specifically designed to attract attention from the opposite sex. 
Letâ€™s be honest: Women sometimes dress for attention. They want guys to look at them. 
But under leftist-feminist theory, they shouldnâ€™t. 
So, as HeatStreet reports, thereâ€™s a Change.org petition that claims this dress code sends the message that â€œwe live in a patriarchal society where men can decide whether a femaleâ€™s clothing is appropriate or inappropriate.â€ 
The dress code, they claim, creates a â€œa sense of shame towards girls [sic] bodiesâ€ and reinforces the notion that â€œyes, it is our fault when girls get raped because they should have covered up and avoided the situation by dressing in a way that does not attract another person.â€ 
Iâ€™m not sure what these women want. Do they want to be able to attend school wearing micro-miniskirts and just bras? Pasties? Maybe we shouldnâ€™t have a dress code at all? 
In reaction to the idiotic controversy, Boston Latin School changed their policy, allowing women to wear â€œleggingsâ€ as long as theyâ€™re not â€œsee-through.â€ The rest of the policy will stay in place until Nov. 1 â€“ then it will probably be changed again. 
Hereâ€™s how their â€œpetitionâ€ reads: By allowing the school to dress code us, we are telling the school several things: Yes, we still live in a patriarchal society where men can decide whether a femaleâ€™s clothing is appropriate or inappropriate. Yes, a body should be covered in order to be attractive. Establishing a sense of shame towards girls bodies is okay and perfectly acceptable. Yes, a girlâ€™s body is a sinful temptation that needs to be covered up at all costs for others to focus on their education. Yes, a femaleâ€™s body is more tempting and sexual than a maleâ€™s body. Yes, it is our fault when girls get raped because they should have covered up and avoided the situation by dressing in a way that does not attract another person. Are these statements correct to you? Is it okay to assign a dress code in this manner? If the answer is NO! then sign this petition to tell Mr. Contompasis to reconsider his dress code restrictions. 
What a bunch of nonsense. These are CHILDREN. They do not get a say in establishing a schoolâ€™s dress code. PERIOD.
