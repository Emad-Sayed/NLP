A load of manure was dumped outside the Democratic Party headquarters in Warren County. 
â€œWhat reasonable person thinks this is OK????â€ party chair Bethe Goldenfield said in a post in the Greater Cincinnati Politics Facebook Group . â€œI wonâ€™t be responding to anyone who thinks this is acceptable behavior. It is ILLEGAL!â€ 
The same thing happened in 2012, Goldenfield noted. The suburban Cincinnati county is overwhelmingly Republican; Mitt Romney got 69 percent of the vote four years ago. Itâ€™s been almost 40 years since a Democrat was elected to countywide office. 
Goldenfield told The Enquirer the Warren County Sheriffâ€™s Office called her around 7:45 a.m. Saturday alerting her to the manure pile outside the Lebanon building. Deputies met party officials later to review video. 
â€œHopefully the perps will be held accountable for their actions,â€ she said. 
Jeff Monroe, chairman of the Warren County Republican Party, said the GOP had nothing to do with the manure â€œand has offered to help clean things up.â€
