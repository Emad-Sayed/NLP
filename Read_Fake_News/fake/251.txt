Not a lot of teenage boys would go out of their selfish ways to stand up for a teacher like this. He stood up for his teacher when his peer punched her in the face. This young man is certainly respectable! 
A shocking video has emerged showing the moment a protective student knocked out a classmate who had just attacked their female teacher. The footage shows that the teacher was trying to break up a fight between two students â€“ one in a red hoodie and one in a black hoodie â€“ when the boy in the red turns around and hits her in the face. The teacher, dressed in white and wearing glasses, appears to fall to the ground after being hit, and then leaves the classroom. 
Then, a third student comes in and punches the boy in head, sending him straight down to the ground. The third student is heard saying: â€Watch the fâ€” out, you just hit the fucking teacher.â€™ He then adds: â€Chill your sâ€”, you just hit the fâ€”ing teacher, you donâ€™t fâ€”ing do that. Who the fâ€” do you think you are?â€™ 
The teacher then reappears in the room, and appears relatively unscathed. She tells the group to stop fighting and separate.â€He just fâ€”ing hit you, thatâ€™s not cool,â€™ says the boy that came to her defense.â€Itâ€™s not cool,â€™ the teacher replies. It is unclear where the video was filmed or what school was involved, however the clip was spreading quickly on social media on Wednesday after appearing on the website LiveLeak. Some viewers questioned whether the boy in red may have mistakenly hit the teacher, believing she were the other one of the students. However others said he clearly meant to hit the woman. 
Shout out to the boy for standing up for what is right! Related Items
