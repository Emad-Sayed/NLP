A man who was believed to be on ecstasy has reportedly had a five hour chat with a hand after a girl he was trying to chat up told him to â€œtalk to the hand â€cause the face ainâ€™t listeningâ€. 
Simon Webber, a twenty six year old used car salesman from Worcester, England, claims to have had a â€œreally good chatâ€ with â€œthe handâ€ and hopes they can â€œgrab a coffeeâ€ some time in the future. 
â€œThe hand was totally peng mate,â€ claimed Mr Webber during a catch up with Wunderground earlier today. â€œThe girl who owned the hand was well fit so I tried to talk to her but she actually turned out to be a bit of a dick and told me to talk to her hand. Iâ€™m really glad now because I instantly hit it off with the hand.â€ 
â€œIâ€™ve not connected with anything like that since the time I took acid while I was camping in the Lake District and met a goat named Boris in the forest,â€ continued Mr Webber. â€œSometimes I feel like Iâ€™ve got more in common with things than people, itâ€™s like I canâ€™t have a good conversation with something unless theyâ€™re not able to answer me back.â€ 
â€œMe and the hand talked about all kinds of stuff,â€ revealed a reminiscent Mr Webber. â€œBrexit, the U.S. elections, diseases that have been eradicated, the potential dangers of genetically modifying food, chemtrail and all sorts of other really interesting things. Sheâ€™s a great listener, I didnâ€™t get her number but Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll see her around. Hopefully we can hang out again, I donâ€™t want to be getting ahead of myself but I think she could be the one.â€ 
According to Stacey Poole, the owner of the hand, she had her Saturday night ruined by â€œsome little creatureâ€ who was following her around the club all night. 
â€œI was just trying to have a good night but that little cretin wouldnâ€™t leave me alone,â€ complained Stacey. â€œHe tried to talk to me but he was off his nut so I gave him the old â€talk to the handâ€™ line and put my hand in his face. The daft twat took it literally and started talking to my hand, at first it was kind of funny but I couldnâ€™t get rid of him, he was following me everywhere, eventually I just had to leave. He ruined my night.â€
