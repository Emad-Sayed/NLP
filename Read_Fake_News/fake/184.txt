Maria Daly reported a burglary at her home in Millbury on October 17 and claimed her jewelry and some money had been stolen. She told police her home had been graffitied with the letters, â€œBLM.â€ 
â€œSomething wasnâ€™t quite right,â€ Millbury Police Chief Donald Desorcy said . â€œI think that was pretty obvious and as a result of that investigation, the officers did their due diligence and followed through with the investigation that we had.â€ This is white supremacist Maria Daly, the wife of Boston cop Daniel Daly.She staged a fake robbery of her home, and tried to blame #BLM pic.twitter.com/vrdqg1cM6r

CBS Boston reports Daly took to social media soon after the fabricated robbery, saying, â€œWe woke up to not only our house being robbed while we were sleeping, but to see this hatred for no reason.â€ 
â€œIf you would of [sic] asked me yesterday about this blue lives and black lives matter issue my response would of [sic] been very possitive [sic],â€ the now private Facebook account continues. â€œToday on the other hand I have so much anger and hate that I donâ€™t like myself. This is what we have to deal with these days and it makes me sick that this is what was on the side of my house.â€ 
Despite Dalyâ€™s best efforts, the police were able to tell no robbery took place. @crystalhaynes The poor lady just needs some help..

â€œBasically we came to the conclusion that it was all fabricated,â€ said Desorcy. â€œThere was no intruder, there was no burglary.â€ 
Police concluded Daly fabricated the robbery due to financial difficulty. Daly confessed and returned the items she claimed were missing, which amounted to $10,000 in jewelry. 
Desorcy told reporters, â€œWe werenâ€™t going to sweep this under the rug,â€ and that he felt sorry for the family.

So, is she going to be brought up on the same charges that any one of us would be for staging a crime and lying to police, or will she avail herself of Blue (Dick Holster) Privilege? Social
