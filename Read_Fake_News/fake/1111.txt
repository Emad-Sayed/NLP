REMEMBER the dress debacle last year when billions of online users across the world were at war with one another over whether or not a dress was black and blue or white and gold? Well, prepare to engage in battle yet again folks with this viral picture thatâ€™s totes dividing the internets. 
Uploaded to numerous social media channels yesterday morning, this picture of a Syrian man has gone viral after users struggled to figure out whether or not he was covered in white rubble from an airstrike â€“ or if he was just all shiny and covered in some kind of silly oil. 
â€œOnce you see it, you just canâ€™t see anything else,â€ posted one absolute genius, who pretty much summed up the whole picture with one epic tweet containing just 40 characters. 

Whilst many internet players were quick to point out that the Aleppo man was shiny or covered in plastic, others corrected them by pointing out that the man was actually covered in concrete dust from an Assad led airstrike which launched an illegal barrel bomb that killed at least 15 people, many of whom were women and children. 
â€œItâ€™s crazy how your eyes deceive you like that,â€ pointed out another user of the internet web, â€œIâ€™d say the guy didnâ€™t know what hit him after his picture went viralâ€. 
In fact, on closer inspection, it becomes obvious that the man is covered head to toe in chalk like material, probably from exploding concrete and falling rubble, as well as what appears to be ketchup on his forearm. Instagram user @reuters, who originally posted the snap, confirmed the red residue was in fact blood, sending the internet into yet another meltdown.
