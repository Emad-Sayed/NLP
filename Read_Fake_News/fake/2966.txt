Will James Comey Change the Outcome of the Election? Is this the game-changing October surprise that many hope for -- and others dread? November 2, 2016 
Bruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. 
FBI Director James Comeyâ€™s reopening of the investigation into Clintonâ€™s emails has roiled once more the presidential election. Donald Trump has called the decision â€œcourageousâ€ and â€œbigger than Watergate.â€ Clinton, the DOJ, Democrat Senators, and their media flying monkeys are all having conniption fits over their quondam championâ€™s defection, calling the announcement â€œappalling,â€ â€œabsurd,â€ â€œstrange,â€ â€œdeeply troubling,â€ an â€œattack,â€ and â€œunprecedented.â€ The bigger question is whether it will move enough voters over to Trumpâ€™s side and put him in the White House. 
Thereâ€™s no doubt that Comeyâ€™s announcement eleven days before the election is mystifying. Not because it is â€œunprecedentedâ€ as the Democrats keep squealing. They had no such qualms when the weekend before the 1992 election, special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh indicted a poll-surging George H.W. Bush for his alleged involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal. No, the mystery is Comeyâ€™s motives. Is Comey like Conradâ€™s Lord Jim, now sacrificing his FBI careerâ€“â€“sure to be over if the notoriously vengeful Clinton is electedâ€“â€“ to atone for having besmirched his office, reputation, and the principle of equality before the law in service to careerist self-interest? Or was he facing a mutiny and leaks from disgruntled FBI investigators? To quote one of our candidates, â€œAt this point, what difference does it make?â€ 
The real question is whether it will make a difference to the voters. Right now we donâ€™t know if the content of the 650,000 emails from the conjugal laptop used by serial sexter Anthony Weiner, estranged husband of Clinton vizier Huma Abedin, will reveal something damning like, say, classified materials. But we already know that Clinton passed classified information over an unsecured server, which didnâ€™t bother Comey back in July. So what could be in these new emails that rises above Comeyâ€™s sophistic â€œextreme carelessness,â€ and reaches the statuteâ€™s â€œgross negligenceâ€? Or has Comey found new evidence of Hillaryâ€™s â€œintent,â€ his other exculpatory sophistry that had little to do with the law? There had to be something that made Comey subject himself to the scorched-earth wrath of the Democrats. 
Whatever is found on the Abedin laptop, one wonders if will even matter to a sufficient number of voters. They have shrugged off so many scandals, lies, and failures that should have sunk a candidacy, that itâ€™s hard to calculate what level of incompetence, unpleasantness, dishonesty, sleaze, and crime is disqualifying anymore. Here are the greatest hits from Hillaryâ€™s catalogue: Whitewater Missing billing records from her tenure at the Rose Law Firm Renting out the Lincoln Bedroom to donors Travelgate Illegal possession of FBI files Conducting illegal secret meetings of the Task Force on National Health Care Reform Cackling over keeping a pedophile rapist out of jail Hounding the victims of her husbandâ€™s sexual assaults and philandering Stealing $200,000 worth of china, furniture, and artwork from the White House Claiming she landed under â€œsniper fireâ€ in Bosnia Claiming she and Bill left the White House â€œdead brokeâ€ Shaking down Wall Street while assuring the Orcs of capitalism that sheâ€™s got their back Charging exorbitant speaking fees for a half hour of banalities and bromides Calling 30,000 missing emails â€œpersonalâ€ communications Lying about the Benghazi attack to the faces of the four dead Americansâ€™ families Supporting the lie that the attacks were caused by an obscure Internet video when she knew the same night that they werenâ€™t Perjuring herself before Congress and the FBI about the emails and her private server The disastrous overthrow of Ghaddafi in Libya The disastrous â€œresetâ€ with Russia The disastrous nuclear deal with Iran The disastrous withdrawal from Iraq The corrupt Clinton Foundation and its wholly owned subsidiary, the pay-to-play State Department Using feminist rhetoric while taking cash from some of the planetâ€™s most brutally misogynistic regimes Serially flip-flopping on issues like same-sex marriage, the Trans Pacific Trade deal, and the Keystone pipeline Promising to â€œraise taxes on the middle classâ€ and â€œput coal miners out of workâ€ Her campaign staffâ€™s dirty tricks against Trump and his supporters Her campaign staffâ€™s incestuous relationship with the media Her staffâ€™s illegal destruction of incriminating evidence during the email investigation Her strong support of gruesome late-term abortions And, last but not least, the continuing unanswered questions about her physical and cognitive health 
Back in the day, just a few of these gaffes, deceptions, and failures would probably have sunk a campaign for Congress, let alone the White House. 
And Mr. Trumpâ€™s offenses? Heâ€™s talks exactly as youâ€™d expect a New York real estate developer, casino owner, reality television star, and beauty pageant mogul to talk Heâ€™s condemned as a sexual assaulter for saying a decade ago what Bill Clinton and every White-House-visiting rapper, movie star, or rock star knows about the sexual perks of celebrity: â€œWhen youâ€™re a star they let you do it,â€ as Trump bragged of his crude sexual advances Heâ€™s ignorant of policy He doesnâ€™t understand the economics of global trade He doesnâ€™t know what the â€œnuclear triadâ€ is Heâ€™s addicted to a half dozen superlative adjectives He wants to build a wall with Mexico He takes legal advantage of tax law Heâ€™s not â€œsuitableâ€ for office He does not have the right â€œtemperamentâ€ Heâ€™s used bankruptcy as a business tool Heâ€™s accused of groping over a dozen women, including a polymorphously perverse porn star Heâ€™s mean and insulting He has orange hair 
In short, Trump lacks the superficial patina of rhetorical decorum and sober demeanor that most modern presidents and candidates spray over their public personas in order to hide their private flaws and vices. Just ask Hillaryâ€™s various Secret Service details how wide the distance between public and private personalities can be. 
The voters will decide for themselves which candidateâ€™s catalogue of sins is more disqualifying and dangerous. But whatever happens, itâ€™s clear that we the people have lowered the bar of acceptability for presidential candidates. 
This transformation happened decades before Trump and Hillary came along. After Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury related to his sordid sexual depredations in the White House, his approval ratings were 73%. He left the White House with a 66% rating, higher than any president since Harry Truman, including Ronald Reagan. Think about it: the president who sexually exploited an intern and was impeached for perjury left office with higher approval ratings than the president who rescued the economy and tossed the Soviet Union into its own dustbin of history. 
That was the inflection point for our political culture. No wonder that Barack Obamaâ€™s lack of any real-world experience or achievement, left-wing views, self-confessed drug use, friends like the anti-American racist Jeremiah Wright and unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers, and gaping holes in his biography were unimportant to 45 million voters. So why now are we shocked, shocked that off-brand candidates like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are vying for the presidency? Decrying these candidates is closing the barn door after the horses of virtue, wisdom, and decorum have already long gone. 
So absent a smoking howitzer in the next WikiLeaks dump, Comeyâ€™s restart of the investigation, which in any case will take months to complete, will probably not be the game-changing October surprise many hope for and others dread, especially given a corrupt mediaâ€™s studied indifference to anything that damages their candidate. Then again, the rapid erosion of Hillaryâ€™s support is drawing analogies to Reaganâ€™s late surge against Carter. 
Either way, on November 8, most people will vote their economic interests and their ideological passions, and decide based on subjective perceptions and silly criteria like â€œcares for people like me.â€ Or they might just finally realize that Hillaryâ€™s accumulated offenses are intolerable. But what that standard of selection will deliver is anybodyâ€™s guess.
