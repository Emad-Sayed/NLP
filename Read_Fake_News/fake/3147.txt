[Ed. â€“ Now teaching the gospel of racial grievance.] 
San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick hosted a â€œKnow Your Rightsâ€ camp for Oakland-area youth Saturday, an event designed to expand his focus on social and racial injustice beyond his national anthem protest. 
â€œThis is exciting for me because I see a lot of hope, what is to come,â€ Kaepernick said beforehand, in an interview with The Undefeatedâ€™s Marc J. Spears . 
Kaepernick said the campers, who numbered around 100, would have sessions to learn about situations with police, their rights, holistic health, financial literacy, and understanding both community and self. He said the campâ€™s aim is to â€œempower youth, give them resources and toolsâ€ to deal with difficult situations. 
â€œWe want to let them know they have options and people that are behind them to help them,â€ he said. â€œAnd thatâ€™s a powerful thing, for someone else to have belief in you.â€
