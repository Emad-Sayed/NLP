Hillary supporter Robert Dougherty from Jacksonville, North Carolina bragged on Facebook today about how he committed voter fraud. 
Robert boasted on how he voted for some of his Facebook friends using their identities, and tells them not to worry about voting, because heâ€™s already done it for them. 
And heâ€™s bragging about it on Facebook. 
Robert boasts about how they give you a sticker every time you vote. 
He says he will continue to vote all next week! 
â€œIsnâ€™t North Carolina nice they give you a sticker every time you voteâ€¦ No ID required.â€ 
â€œThere isnâ€™t a need for you to wait in line anymore. Took care of it for you. Gave you a straight Democratic ticket.â€ 
â€œAmazing how many addresses you get from Google. Going again until Saturday and all next week.â€ 
Robert either thinks voter fraud is a big joke or heâ€™s one stupid Hillary-supporting criminal. 
What do you think, will Voter Fraud play a key role in the election?
