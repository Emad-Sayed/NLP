IN the clearest indication yet that US/Russian relations may be at an all-time low post-Cold War, Russian leader Vladimir Putin is staunchly refusing to open a Snapchat he received from his US counterpart Barack Obama. 
â€œIf Putin opens it, itâ€™s a poor political play. It shows heâ€™s curious, interested in what Obama has to say. By not opening it, heâ€™s telling Obama and the world that he has something better to do with his time,â€ explained app and politics expert Morgan Wilde. 
A number of Snapchat users have become heavily invested in the ongoing brinkmanship between the two superpowers who are locked in a series of countermeasures in Syria, which have left lives of innocent civilians in the balance and with rumours persisting that Putin hasnâ€™t looked at any Western leadersâ€™ Snapchat stories in weeks, the outlook is bleak. 
â€œOh, shit, I didnâ€™t realise it was all this serious,â€ said one Snapchat user, who had finally begun to understand the full extent of the deterioration of the diplomatic relationship. 
â€œItâ€™s one thing to be squabbling over Aleppo, and accusations of war crimes, but it really hits home when itâ€™s played out on my favourite app,â€ added Snapchat user Ciaran Bergin. 
However, some political commentators have urged people not to read too much into the exchange. 
â€œLook, who knows what the Snap contained, it could have just been Obama with a dog face, his way of reaching out to Putin and saying â€God, itâ€™s lonely at the top, isnâ€™t it? Now, how funny do I look with dog ears and a big tongue?â€™ Letâ€™s not panic about this,â€ shared commentator Henrietta Norris. 
There is some hope in Russia circles that Putin was simply taking a day off the app as heâ€™s sick of seeing the same 4 or 5 people send Snapchats all day long.
