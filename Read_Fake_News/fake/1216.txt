Ever try Googling someone only to come up with basic information and maybe a link or two to an outdated social media profile? Thereâ€™s a new website going around that promises to reveal much more than just a simple google search can show you. 
Been issued a speeding ticket? Failed to stop at a stop sign? What about your family members? And friends? If you are like most of us, the answer to at least one of those questions is â€œyesâ€â€”the vast majority of us have slipped up at least once or twice. 
An innovative new website â€” Instant Checkmate is now revealing the full â€œscoopâ€ on millions of Americans. 
Instant Checkmate aggregates hundreds of millions of publicly available criminal, traffic, and arrest records and posts them online so they can easily be searched by anyone. Members of the site can literally begin searching within seconds, and are able to check as many records as they like (think: friends, family, neighbors, etc. etc.). 
Previously, if you wanted to research someoneâ€™s arrest records, you might have had to actually go into a county court officeâ€”in the appropriate countyâ€”and formally request information on an individual. This process may have taken days or weeks, or the information might not have been available at all. With websites like Instant Checkmate , however, a background check takes just a few clicks of the mouse, and no more than a minute or two. 
While preparing this article, I decided to run a quick search on myself to give the service a real-world test. To my dismay, the search revealed several items Iâ€™d long forgottenâ€”one of them being for the possession of a fake ID I was (embarrassingly) issued back in college when I was just 18 years old. â€œpossession of a fake ID I was (embarrassingly) issued back in college when I was just 18 years oldâ€ 
After searching myself and finding those records, my curiosity was piqued, and I began researching family membersâ€”apparently my aunt Susanne isnâ€™t a very good driver, judging by the numerous traffic citations that showed on her record. 
One of the most interesting aspects of Instant Checkmate is that it shows not only criminal records, but also more general background information like court records, various types of licenses (FAA, DEA), previous addresses, phone numbers, birthdates, estimated income levels and even satellite imagery of known addressesâ€”itâ€™s really pretty scary just how much information is in these reports. 
In addition to giving information on the specific person you search for, the report also includes a scrolling list of â€œlocal sex offendersâ€ for whatever region youâ€™ve searchedâ€”along with a map plotting out the locations of those offenders. I started perusing the ones that showed up in my report, and I was absolutely blown away when I stumbled upon my junior high school wrestling coachâ€™s mug shot. 
â€œI was absolutely blown away when I stumbled upon my junior high school wrestling coachâ€™s mug shot.â€ 
His crime was listed as â€œOut of state offense,â€â€ so I wasnâ€™t able to get the specifics (you usually canâ€”this was an unusual case), but he was definitely a registered sex offender. Scary stuff. 
I would definitely recommend this tool to friends and family. Anyone can start running background checks on Instant Checkmate within a few secondsâ€”just click this link to get started. If you would like to search someone you know, click here . Note from the Author 
I have to warn you before you start your search, the information you find may be overwhelming and has the potential of changing your view of the search subject forever. Keep this in mind when completing your search . â€“ Heidi R.
