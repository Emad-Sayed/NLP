These sources said, yes, the investigations will continues [sic], thereâ€™s a lot of evidence, and barring some obstruction in some way, they believe theyâ€™ll continue to, likely, an indictment.â€ Baier didnâ€™t say exactly who would be the most most likely target of an indictment, nor the timeline. Baiser sources: Greater than 99 percent confidence that Clintonâ€™s private email server had been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies. 
(WASHINGTON, DC) Citing sources at the FBI, Fox News anchor Bret Baier said the FBIâ€™s renewed investigation of Hillary Clintonâ€™s email server will almost certainly end in an indictment, unless some sort of â€œobstructionâ€ arises. 
Baier made the claim Wednesday night during a broadcast of â€œOn the Recordâ€ with Brit Hume. He said that a â€œlot of evidenceâ€ had been recovered from Anthony Wienerâ€™s laptop, and made an eventual indictment appear very likely, even if it came months after the election. 
â€œI pressed, again and again, on this very issue,â€ Baier told Hume. â€œThese sources said, yes, the investigations will continues [sic], thereâ€™s a lot of evidence, and barring some obstruction in some way, they believe theyâ€™ll continue to, likely, an indictment.â€ 
Baier didnâ€™t say exactly who would be the most most likely target of an indictment, and what the timeline on such an indictment would be. 
Baier also said that his sources had greater than 99 percent confidence that Clintonâ€™s private email server had been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies. When FBI Director James Comey first announced last summer that no charges would be recommended regarding Clintonâ€™s server, he said the FBI had no way of knowing whether the server had been hacked. 
Clintonâ€™s presidential campaign aggressively downplayed the severity of the renewed investigation into her private email server, and criticized the judgment of Comey for publicly announcing it.
