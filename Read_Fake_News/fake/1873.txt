Icelandâ€™s Pirate Party has tripled its seats in the 63-seat parliament, Saturday nightâ€™s election results show. 
Birgitta Jonsdottir, the leader of the Pirate Party, said she was satisfied with the result. â€œWhatever happens, we have created a wave of change in the Icelandic society,â€ she told a cheering crowd early Sunday morning. 
The Pirates won 10 seats, more than tripling its three seats in the last election. The Left-Green Party also won 10 seats Saturday. 
The left-leaning parties â€” the Left-Greens, the Pirates and two allies â€” won a total of 27 seats, just short of the 32 required to command a majority in Icelandâ€™s Parliament, the worldâ€™s oldest.

The governing center-right Progressive party lost more than half of its seats in the election which was triggered by Prime Minister Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson â€s resignation in April in the wake of the leaked Panama Papers which revealed the offshore assets of high-profile figures. 
Current Prime Minister Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson said he would resign on Sunday. 
The anti-establishment Pirate Party, which was founded in 2012, had said it could be looking to form a coalition with three left-wing and centrist parties. 
The Piratesâ€™ core issues are: direct democracy, freedom of expression, civil rights, net neutrality, and transparency, all set out in a popular, crowdsourced draft of a new national Constitution that the current government has failed to act on. They also seek to re-nationalize the countryâ€™s natural resource industries, create new rules for civic governance, and issue a passport to Edward Snowden.

Pirate Party founder and MP Birgitta Jonsdottir said she was â€œvery satisfiedâ€ with the result. 
â€œOur internal predictions showed 10 to 15%, so this is at the top of the range. We knew that we would never get 30%,â€ Ms Jonsdottir told Reuters. â€œWe want to see trickle-down ethics rather than make-believe trickle-down economics,â€ Ms. Jonsdottir, 49, who is also a former WikiLeaks activist, said 
â€œWe are a platform for young people, for progressive people who shape and reshape our society,â€ Ms. Jonsdottir told Agence France-Presse. â€œLike Robin Hood, because Robin Hood was a pirate, we want to take the power from the powerful to give it to the people.â€ Turnout in Iceland was 79.2%! If the US got anywhere near that, this would be a dramatically more progressive country. pic.twitter.com/9uCBBewNz2 â€” John Nichols (@NicholsUprising) October 30, 2016 TAGS:
