Voters have been concerned about Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clintonâ€™s involvement in the scandal-ridden Clinton Foundation. 
Liberal journalist Bob Woodward legitimized those concerns Sunday on Fox News by pointing to the Foundationâ€™s â€œ pay-for-play â€ scandals while Clinton served as secretary of state as something that should trouble voters. 
Woodward, who broke the Watergate story that led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon, told host Chris Wallace in no uncertain terms that the Clinton Foundation is â€œcorruptâ€ and a â€œscandal.â€ 
Watch Woodwardâ€™s comments on Fox News Sunday here: 
â€œThere are allegations about the Clinton Foundation and pay-for-play,â€ Wallace said. â€œWhen you see what seems to be clear evidence that Clinton Foundation donors were being treated differently than non-donors in terms of access, when you see this new revelations (sic) about the $12 million deal between Hillary Clinton, the Foundation and the King of Morocco, are voters right to be troubled by this?â€ 
â€œYes,â€ Woodward responded. â€œ Itâ€™s corrupt . Itâ€™s a scandal.â€ 
Wallace had attempted to get answers from Clinton about the issue at the final presidential debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump. 
But of course Clinton ducked the moderatorâ€™s question and instead talked about the organizationâ€™s charitable donations rather than its extreme conflicts of interest â€” something Woodward took note of and criticized her for. 
â€œShe didnâ€™t answer your question at all,â€ Woodward told Wallace. â€œAnd she turned to embrace the good work that the Clinton Foundation has done.â€ 
Woodward apparently didnâ€™t want to discredit the â€œgood workâ€ done by the organization, but pointed out that even its â€œgood workâ€ is compromised by the overwhelming evidence of corruption. 
â€œ(T)he mixing of speech fees, the Clinton Foundation and actions by the State Department â€” which she ran â€” are all intertwined and itâ€™s corrupt,â€ he argued. 
Heâ€™s correct: The Clinton Foundation is corrupt, and voters should be troubled by Clintonâ€™s role in the unethical pay-for-play scandals. 
Unfortunately Clinton has an acute ability to avoid being held accountable for her scandals, but we have faith in the American people and their desire to be led by a person with integrity and respect for the office he holds, not someone who continuously looks for ways for his political power to benefit his personal life.
