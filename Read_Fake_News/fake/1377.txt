Doctors Restore Ken Burnsâ€™ Full-Color Vision After Removing Massive Tumor From Filmmakerâ€™s Visual Cortex Close Vol 52 Issue 43 · News · Celebrities · Entertainment · Healthcare 
CLEVELANDâ€”Speaking to reporters following the successful eight-hour procedure Tuesday, neurosurgeons at the Cleveland Clinic confirmed they had removed a golf ballâ€“sized tumor from the visual cortex of filmmaker Ken Burns, restoring the documentarianâ€™s ability to see in full color. â€œWeâ€™re happy to report that the surgery went smoothly, and beginning today, Mr. Burns will no longer be limited to perceiving the world in shades of black, white, and sepia, and will instead be able to experience the entire spectrum of hues that most of us take for granted,â€ said Dr. Amrita Singh, noting that the 63-year-old director and producer of The Civil War , Prohibition , and Jazz had awakened from anesthesia and was reported to be marveling at the vividness of his surroundings, human faces, and photographs. â€œIt appears that the removal of this tumor also reduced intense pressure that had built up inside Mr. Burnsâ€™ visual processing center; as a result, his eyesight has sharpened considerably, and heâ€™ll notice that he wonâ€™t need to lean in close anymore to make out the details of images. Itâ€™s going to seem like a whole new world to him.â€ Dr. Singh added that an additional inner-ear surgery would be required to correct the balance issue that causes Burns to slowly drift from left to right.
