FBI Sources believe Clinton Foundation case is â€œlikely moving toward an indictmentâ€ Fox News Channelâ€™s Bret Baier reports the latest news about the Clinton Foundation investigation from two sources inside the FBI. He reveals five important new pieces of information: 1. The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year. 2. The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. The investigation has interviewed several people twice, and plans to interview some for a third time. 3. Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clintonâ€™s secret server on Anthony Weinerâ€™s laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature. 4. Sources within the FBI have told him that an indictment is â€œlikelyâ€ in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation, â€œbarring some obstruction in some wayâ€ from the Justice Department. 5. FBI sources say with 99% accuracy that Hillary Clintonâ€™s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information had been taken from it.
