Trump voter listens carefully to call for national unity then sets up Aryan website 11-11-16 
A DONALD Trump supporter listened carefully to the president-electâ€™s call for national unity before registering the domain name for a white supremacist website. 
Brent Logan, from Ohio, paid $19.99 for aryanknightsofamerica.net and said he hoped it would be a website for all Americans, â€except the black, hispanic, Asian, Muslim and Jewish onesâ€™. 
He added: â€œBut theyâ€™re not American anyway. Which is what President Trump has been saying all along. 
â€œWhich us why his call for national unity is so important. He wants to unify us against blacks, hispanics, Asians, Muslims and the Jews. 
â€œHe is a very good public speaker.â€ 
Logan continued: â€œItâ€™s going to be very much an Aryan lifestyle website. Fashion tips for intimidating minorities at a picnic; how to decorate your basement with flags, that sort of thing.â€
