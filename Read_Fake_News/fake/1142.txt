PATIENTS waiting for treatment in a Waterford dental clinic have informed WWN of the curious ration of magazines about boats to magazine about any other topic in the waiting room. 
Maguires Dental on St. Kennethâ€™s street in Waterford city appears to have four magazines about maritime affairs in itâ€™s 9-strong pile of reading literature, with the remainder of the browsing material consisting of 5-year-old issues of Heat, Bella, and an Argos catalogue from 2012 with the back cover ripped off. 
Declan Hanlon, in for a filling, spoke exclusively to WWN about the difficulties in passing the time in the waiting room when one hasnâ€™t got much interest in yachting or yacht maintenance. 
â€œIâ€™m here over an hour like, and Iâ€™ve read up on Ashton Kutcher getting divorced from Demi Moore, the price of an electric shower, and how to make sure youâ€™ve hired the right people to de-barnacle the side of your boatâ€ said Hanlin, sounding kinda funny because his jaw is sore. 
â€œWhoever puts out the magazines, take a bow. Iâ€™ve seen some terrible reading material in waiting rooms in my time, but Jesus Christ this stuff is the worst. Trust me, if youâ€™re coming to this place, you sure as fuck donâ€™t need to learn about boat maintenanceâ€. 
When pressed for better magazines in the waiting room, staff at Maguire Dental said theyâ€™d have a root around in a skip at the weekend, if they had time.
