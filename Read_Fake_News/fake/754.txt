Robert Gehl reports that of all the videos and images to come out of the Milwaukee riots, thereâ€™s one that is particularly chilling. 
The 2-minute video is apparently taken during the riots Saturday night following the shooting of a black, armed man who was reportedly a gang member. 
Moments after the shooting occurred, hundreds of rioters took to the streets, setting cars on fire and burning about a half-dozen businesses. Chants of â€œBlack Power!â€ could be heard sporadically as well. But in this video, it appears an entire gang of black youth are seeking out and targeting white people to assault.
â€œHey! Weâ€™re beating up every white person! Get every white person!â€ the cameraman says. 
When he witnesses someone being assaulted, he asks â€œWho they beatinâ€™ up? Who they beatenâ€™ up?â€ 
At one point, when they spot a â€œwhite person,â€ he screams â€œHe white! Beat his shit! Beat!â€ 
The thug pans around looking for white people to assault. You can hear the crowd reacting, trying to point out white people. Again, he cries: â€œHey! They beating up every white person!â€ Apparently he spots a homeless man. â€œLook at the f***inâ€™ white bum! Look at the white bum!â€
Throughout the rest of the video, thereâ€™s screams of white people as their racist hunt continues. 
Toward the end, shots ring out in the distance, startling the cameraman. â€œWho the f*** is shooting? Stop shooting!â€ Moments later, shots are fired much closer and the video ends.â€ 
This is the direct result of the Black Lives Matter racist, anti-police agenda and Barack Obamaâ€™s acceptance of their cause. 
This is Obamaâ€™s â€œ post-racial America .â€ Welcome to it, folks .
