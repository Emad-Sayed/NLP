Thanks to Wikileaks, we now have the smoking gun email irrefutably proving not only did President Barack Obama know about Hillary Clintonâ€™s non-government-issued email account, he used it in correspondence with her.
Even more damning to the presidentâ€™s credibility, it appears the lie was a purposeful attempt to protect Clintonâ€™s upcoming bid for the presidency.
Shortly after the New York Times broke the story on March 2, 2015, of Clintonâ€™s use of a personal server to supplant the government system â€” and, as has been revealed, to thwart transparency â€” Obama announced publicly his lack of prior knowledge.
â€œThe same time everybody else learned it through news reports,â€ the president told CBS News White House correspondent Bill Plante, as Zero Hedge reported . â€œThe policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the BlackBerry I carry around, all those records are available and archived.
â€œIâ€™m glad that Hillaryâ€™s instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed.â€
It wouldnâ€™t be a stretch to imagine, however, Obamaâ€™s placid public appearance guarded secret internal panic â€” a panic echoed behind the scenes at the burgeoning Clinton campaign.
An email penned by Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin to Director of Communications, Jennifer Palmieri, and a few others, calling immediate attention to a tweet by journalist Katherine Miller paints an entirely different picture.
Miller tweeted a snippet of the aforementioned interview in which Plante asked Obama, â€œMr. President, When did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the U.S. Government for official business while she was Secretary of State?â€
â€œThe same time everybody else learned it,â€ he responded, â€œthrough news reports.â€
