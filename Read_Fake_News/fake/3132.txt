After a trainwreck campaign, Trump supporters are struggling to find ways to motivate people to vote for their candidate. Trump has alienated nearly every voting bloc in the country, and routinely smears the sort of people who would otherwise be undecided voters. The question for his supporters is how to get people to set aside their hatred for the man and cast their vote for him anyway. For one horse breeder, the answer is semen. 
In what has been described as â€œgross,â€â€œtotally illegal,â€ and the most Trumpian thing ever, a Texas Trumper posted on his Facebook page that he would be giving a 50 percent off coupon to all Trump voters good for either one breeding session with his stallions, or frozen semen for the horse owner on the go. 
The post was flagged by Talking Points Memoâ€™s Josh Marshall who noted that offering people compensation â€“ even if itâ€™s half off horse semen â€“ for a vote for Trump violates election law. This is totally illegal; also perhaps the most appropriately Trumpian vote buying scheme possible to devise https://t.co/7n0kDam7ZS pic.twitter.com/f11T5dEOmR

After mockery and disbelief swept the internet, the post was deleted from Facebook. Itâ€™s unclear if the postâ€™s creator, Beto Orsi, had a change of heart or merely wanted to avoid the jokes at his expense. From his public profile, itâ€™s clear that he still deeply believes in Donald Trump. And also horses. Hereâ€™s his profile background.
