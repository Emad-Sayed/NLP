The Clinton email scandal has taken an unexpected twist Friday as Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey notified key members of Congress that the agency will be reopening their investigation against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
In a letter to Congress, Comey wrote that the FBI has recently â€œ learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigationâ€ regarding Clintonâ€™s use of a private server during her tenure at the State Department.
While Comey did not elaborate on what those emails contain, the director that the emails were discovered â€œin connection with an unrelated case.â€

He told lawmakers the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier, â€œand I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.â€
He said the FBI could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete â€œthis additional work.â€
Trump, speaking to cheering supporters Friday afternoon in Manchester, N.H., praised the FBI for having the â€œcourageâ€ to â€œright the horrible mistake that they madeâ€ â€“ saying he hopes that is â€œcorrected.â€
â€œHillary Clintonâ€™s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,â€ Trump said. â€œWe must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.â€
In a nod to the significance of the FBIâ€™s announcement, Trump quipped: â€œThe rest of my speech is going to be so boring.â€
We will continue to update as new details surface.
