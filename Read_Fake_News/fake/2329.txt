Lady Gaga took to Trump Tower early Wednesday morning to protest the results of the U.S. election. 
The â€œBad Romanceâ€ singer, a well-known Hillary Clinton supporter, stood outside Donald Trump â€s building and held a sign that read â€œLove trumps hate.â€ As the hours passed Tuesday night and it became clearer that Trump would win the presidency, Gaga tweeted, â€œIn a room full of hope, we will be heard. Stand up for kindness, equality, and love. Nothing will stop us. Say a prayer America.â€ 
Gaga campaigned for Clinton earlier this week, attending a rally where she spoke of Clintonâ€™s strengths. â€œShe has a career in politics that spans decades of experience, education, leadership, and wisdom. Sheâ€™s ready to be president,â€ she said. â€œShe kept going and she kept fighting for womenâ€™s rights. She kept fighting for the care of our children. She kept fighting for those that are in need.â€Trumpâ€™s victory was declared around 2:30 a.m. ET, and during his speech he praised Clintonâ€™s efforts throughout the election. He said she was owed a â€œdeep debt of gratitudeâ€ for all her hard work. â€œWe will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will deal fairly with everyone. We will seek common ground, partnership not conflict,â€ he added in his speech. â€œAmerica will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our destiny.â€
