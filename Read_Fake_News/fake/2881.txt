â€Conspiracy Theoristsâ€™ Believe Theyâ€™ve Found Justice Scaliaâ€™s MURDER Plot Posted on October 27, 2016 by Dawn Parabellum in Politics Share This 
Itâ€™s troubling to uncover the dirty secrets in the emails leaked from John Podesta, Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman, and it just keeps getting worse. Since the mainstream media refuses to do it, many â€œconspiracy theoristsâ€ are investigating for themselves, and internet sleuths believe theyâ€™ve uncovered the murder plot of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Unsurprisingly, the Clintons may have even more blood on their hands. Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia. 
The evidence does look damning. In the email, where coded language and a disjointed writing technique was used, Podesta is offered a â€œscriptâ€ to a â€œmovie.â€ However, thatâ€™s the only normal part of this email. 
The script writer of the movie is asking Podesta to fund the film, which right away makes the exchange odd since the movie isnâ€™t political and Podesta is Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign manager, not a movie investor. It seems even more strange once the plot of the movie is revealed in the emails as well. Whatâ€™s worse, this is not the first email thought to be about the assassination of Antonin Scalia, but I digress. 
The movie is about a â€œMexicanâ€ girl on a journey to find her mother. She crosses paths with a man named Alex who assists her on her journey. They end up at an isolated ranch house with a massive underground tunnel in Tecate, California. There is a Smithsonian map included in a link, which has a line pointing to the â€œsettingâ€ of the film, as seen below. Map included in the Podesta emails showing the â€œsettingâ€ of the â€œmovieâ€ 
The map seems inconspicuous enough until it was realized that the pointer of the map is showing the exact location of the Cibolo Ranch where Antonin Scalia died. Below is a Google map showing the location of the Cibolo Ranch. Google map depicting the location of the Cibolo Ranch 
The maps were enough to draw the attention of internet sleuths. Digging deeper, they have uncovered more in the same email discussing the details of this â€œmovie,â€ and honestly, it doesnâ€™t feel right. The entire script of the â€œmovieâ€ can be read in the leaked emails , but one part stands out in addition to connecting the dots with the maps. Ronald Reagan is discussed for some strange reason 
Itâ€™s difficult to imagine what President Ronald Reagan has to do with a movie about a Mexican womanâ€™s journey, other than the fact that Antonin Scalia was a Reagan appointee. However, it gets a little more creepy further down the slightly discombobulated email. A portion of the lengthy email conspiracy theorists believe details the murder plot of Antonin Scalia 
His five â€œfilm projectsâ€ arenâ€™t detailed. All he says are â€œtwo are political, one is spiritual, and two are just for fun.â€ Conspiracy theorists believe this is a list of his assassinations and the best way to describe who has been killed and why. 
Could this all be an elaborate movie and the email sender a poor writer? That seems unlikely, considering heâ€™s claiming to have written an entire script. But, could conspiracy theorists have jumped the gun? Thatâ€™s also possible. 
Thereâ€™s still no absolute proof that this is the murder plot of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, but with just over one week left until the nation decides who will be the president and Wikileaks still having many more John Podesta emails to release, itâ€™s possible we may see more about this â€œmovieâ€ if thatâ€™s what was really being discussed.
