Email Print It seems like everyone associated with the Clintons has become immune to common sense. The Obama Justice Department will not do anything to hold this woman accountable, even though far better people than her have had their careers ended over similar crimes. However, the NYPD isnâ€™t under Clinton or Obamaâ€™s control. Erik Prince, Blackwater Founder and Former Navy Seal, told Breitbart what the NYPDâ€™s approach might be. According to some of his well-placed sources in the NYPD, Prince told Breitbart the following: â€œThe NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making [in the Anthony Weiner investigation] but they received â€huge push backâ€™ from the Justice Department.â€ as per Breitbart . Why is the NYPD involved in the Clinton case? Well, they werenâ€™t originally, but they made the initial discovery of the new Clinton emails on Anthony Weinerâ€™s laptop. Judging from the amount of information they found on the laptop, it seems the FBI and the State Department had insiders protecting Clinton. Allegedly, the criminal activity found on that laptop is enough to make Al Capone blush. â€œThey found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,â€ Prince said. Prince even gave some insight as to why FBI Director Comey decided to re-open the investigation. In a nutshell, the NYPD forced his hand. â€œThe amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI,â€ Prince said. â€œThey said, â€Weâ€™re going to go public with this if you donâ€™t reopen the investigation and you donâ€™t do the right thing with timely indictments,â€™â€ Prince explained. â€œNYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,â€ Prince elaborated. â€œWeiner and Huma Abedin, his wife â€“ the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years â€“ have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have â€“ they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clintonâ€™s own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.â€ Allegedly, some of the crimes the emails reveal include money laundering, lying, and even sex trafficking young children. The NYPD doesnâ€™t mess around, so they have appointed a new, unbiased, prosecutor in order to investigate these claims by Erik Prince. If only Lynchâ€™s Justice Department knew how to make unbiased appointments. The warning for the voters is simple: if Hillary Clinton is elected, there will a constitutional crisis on our hands. She may very well be the first President to be indicted before her first day in the Oval Office. If these criminal accusations are true, they will lead to such staggering events. It would make Watergate seem like a walk in the park. But, its not too late to do the right thing and avoid all of this. Vote Trump and Hillary will be where she belongs â€” in prison.
