Donald Trump has won the Presidency in a result that wasnâ€™t fuelled by hatred or racism by everyone, or not even perhaps the majority, but nonetheless a result that absolutely every narrow-minded tosspot was definitely hoping for. 
â€œYay!â€ said racist, Simon Williams. 
â€œWhat a great morning to be American â€“ like every morning, obviously, as every other nation is inferior. 
â€œBut this morning is just super-bloody-duper.
