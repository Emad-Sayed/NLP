Ever since the 1920s, doctors have been injecting arthritis patients with gold. Evidently, â€œgold-based medicines have been in use for thousands of years,â€ and remarkably, are still in clinical use as so called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugsâ€”meaning they can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. 
Unfortunately, such drugs can be toxic, even fatal, causing conditions such as gold lung, a gold-induced lung disease. â€œAlthough its use can be limited by the incidence of serious toxicity,â€ injectable gold has been shown to be beneficial. But maybe, some researchers suspected, some of that benefit is the sesame oil thatâ€™s injected, which is used as the liquid carrier for the gold. 
Sesame seeds contain anti-inflammatory compounds, with names like sesamin and sesamol, which researchers suspect â€œmay serve as a potential treatment for various inflammatory diseases.â€ But, these were in vitro studies. First, we have to see if it has an anti-inflammatory effect in people, not just cells in a petri dish. But, there havenâ€™t been any studies on the effects of sesame seeds on inflammatory markers in people with arthritis, for exampleâ€”until now. 
â€œConsidering the high prevalence of osteoarthritisâ€¦and since until now there has not been any human studies to evaluate the effect of sesame in [osteoarthritis] patients, this study was designed to assess the effect of administration of sesame [seeds] on inflammationâ€¦â€ And, they found a significant drop in inflammatory markers. But, what effect did it have on their actual disease? 
Fifty patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were split into two groups; standard treatment, or standard treatment plus about a quarter-cup of sesame seeds a day, for two months. Before they started, they described their pain as about 9 out of 10â€”where zero is no pain, and 10 is the maximum pain tolerable. After two months, the control group felt a little betterâ€”pain down to 7. But, the sesame group dropped down to 3.5â€”significantly lower than the control group. 
The researchers conclude that sesame appeared to have a â€œpositive effect,â€â€œimproving clinical signs and symptoms in patients with knee [osteoarthritis].â€ But, the main problem with this study is that the control group wasnâ€™t given a placebo. Itâ€™s hard to come up with a kind of fake sesame seed. But, without a placebo, they basically compared doing nothing to doing something. And, any time you have patients do something special, you canâ€™t discount the placebo effect. 
But, what are the downsides? I mean thatâ€™s the nice thing about using food as medicineâ€”only good side effects. Though the results are mixed, there have been studies using placebo controls that found that adding sesame seeds to oneâ€™s diet may improve our cholesterol and antioxidant status. And, the amount of sesamin found in as little as about one tablespoon of sesame seeds can modestly lower blood pressure a few points within a monthâ€”enough, perhaps, to lower fatal stroke and heart attack risk by about 5%; potentially saving thousands of lives.
