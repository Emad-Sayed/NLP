Iranians had every right to take over US embassy By Kevin Barrett on November 3, 2016 The â€œDen of Espionageâ€ â€“ the former US Embassy whose top floor was a maze of wiring that tapped every phone call in Iran (click HERE to watch The Debate) 
I think Americans ought to storm and occupy our own NSA, FBI, CIA and Pentagon (as well as the Federal Reserve, CFR, Trilateral Commission, Goldman Sachs and other corporate HQs etc. etc.) just like the Iranian students did to the Den of Espionage in 1979. Does that make me an Iranian stooge or an American patriot? Watch The Debate and make up your own mind. â€“Kevin Barrett 
Press TV Debate , featuring Kevin Barrett , Veterans Today Editor 
The 13th day of the Iranian calendar month of Aban, which falls on November 3, is known as the Student Day in Iran, marking the National Day of Fight against Global Arrogance. On this day 37 years ago, a group of Iranian university students took over the US embassy in Tehran, which had turned into a center of espionage aimed at overthrowing the Islamic Republic following the countryâ€™s Islamic Revolution earlier in 1979. 
Press TV has spoken to Kevin Barrett, an author and Middle East expert, as well as Maxine Dovere, a journalist and political commentator, to get their take on this issue. 
Barrett believes the US embassy in Iran was a â€œCIA stationâ€ which was used to â€œrun the countryâ€ before the revolution, adding that Iranian students had every right to take it over. 
He also said the United States was using its embassy to essentially â€œdominateâ€ and â€œexploitâ€ Iran through the puppet government of the Shah whose â€œtorturers were trained by the CIA.â€ 
The analyst further stated the US is an â€œaggressive imperial powerâ€ which has been waging wars of â€œdisguised aggressionâ€ throughout the world. 
He also opined that the United States is â€œtodayâ€™s supreme war criminalâ€ which has been using the word â€œpreemptive warâ€ to legitimize its â€œnaked undisguised aggressionsâ€ after the â€œneoconservative-Zionist coup dâ€™©tat of September 11, 2001.â€ 
â€œThe neoconservatives in particular after their coup dâ€™©tat on September 11, 2001 made it clear that any country in the world that seeks parity with the United States must be destroyed preemptively and that is essentially the situation we have today as the US Empire is out there crushing the Middle East, destroying all of Israelâ€™s enemies through balkanization, through Oded Yinon Plan to break up these countries into smaller units along ethnic and sectarian lines, getting ready for a war with China and provoking a war with Russia through aggressive actions in Ukraine and through the destruction of Syria and threats against Russia when Russia comes to the defense of Syria,â€ he said. 
Elsewhere in his remarks, Barrett noted that both US presidential candidates are â€œquite horrificâ€ in their policies toward the Middle East â€“ namely Iran. 
He also asserted that Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei is â€œabsolutely rightâ€ in saying that he cannot trust the United States and that Tehran has to â€œrethinkâ€ the opening it has had towards Washington. 
Ayatollah Khamenei has warned that compromise with the United States will not resolve Iranâ€™s problems as Washington has not set aside its hostilities towards the Iranian nation. 
Meanwhile the other panelist on Press TVâ€™s program, Maxine Dovere, mentioned that taking over an embassy is not â€œan acceptable diplomatic actionâ€ anywhere in the world. 
â€œAn embassy is sacred ground for any country in any other country. Having a diplomatic dispute is certainly one of the things that happens in political and diplomatic life but taking over an embassy and holding diplomats hostage is not within the realm of normal political behavior,â€ she said. 
According to the commentator, the United States and Iran need to come to â€œa civil understandingâ€ and â€œa trust,â€ adding that part of this process is eliminating the shaky foundations that have existed until 2016. 
Elsewhere in her remarks, she dismissed the US election campaign as a â€œnegative personality cultâ€ which has not concentrated on policy, economics, and foreign relations. 
She also said all the important issues that a president eventually has to deal with seem to have gotten lost in this election campaign. Related Posts:
