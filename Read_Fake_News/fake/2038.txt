[10/31/16] A public school official in Florida has urged citizens to fight truancy by reporting any children they suspect might not be in school or being educated â€” including homeschool families. 
It is all part of an â€œanti-truancyâ€ initiative called Operation Round Up, in which residents of Jackson County, Florida, are urged to be on the lookout for children not in school and to report them to school officials or to police. 
A truancy report can lead to a home check by sheriffâ€™s deputies or police and possibly the arrest of the parents, TV station WJHG reported. 
The policy of the Jackson County School District is to send law enforcement to the homes of suspected truants. 
â€œSometimes if these citizens donâ€™t call me, I have no way of knowing,â€ Shirl Williams, director of student services for the school system, told the TV station. â€œSo if itâ€™s a nosy neighbor, be a nosy neighbor. Just call me and let me check out the situation.â€ Post navigation
