In this latest Project Veritas video an undercover journalist is offered Huma Abedinâ€™s ballot while wearing a full burka and not even questioned.
She is then told that she can vote via a paper ballot instead of voting with a voting machine. Alan Schulkin, a Democratic Elections Commissioner in NYC then explains on video how voter fraud can be committed when people wear burkas inside polling locations on Election Day.
The video starts with the undercover PV journalist talking to Alan Schulkin, the Democratic Elections Commissioner in NYC in which the journalist says, â€œNot only just voter ID because of voting twice, but people can cover their faces, you know what Iâ€™m saying?â€
Alan Schulkin responds, â€œWell the Muslims can do that too. You donâ€™t know who they are.â€
The PV journalist then proceeds to test out the information that Alan Schulkin gave to her. An election official then questions the journalist dressed in full burka.
â€œDo you know where youâ€™re going?â€ The journalist responds, â€œNo.â€
The official then asks the PV journalist for her address in which she responds â€œ254 Park Avenue South.â€
The election official then gives the PV journalist a number in line. The video cuts back to Alan Schulkin and the PV journalistâ€™s conversation in which the PV journalist says, â€œEspecially, all those burkas someone could claim, oh itâ€™s my religion, but then you donâ€™t know if they are pretending or not.â€
Alan Schulkin responds â€œExactly!â€
The journalist then proceeds to vote under the name â€œHuma Abedin,â€ after talking to an election official who greets her with â€œGood morning, last name?â€
The PV journalist responds, â€œAbedinâ€
What follows is shocking, â€œSince we donâ€™t have your name in the book. You can fill out an affidavit ballot. Ok?â€ the official says.
The official then asks the PV journalist if she is â€œDemocrat or Republican?â€ The journalist responds troll-fully â€œHuma Abedin is a registered Democrat.â€
The election official then responds â€œI donâ€™t have your name in the book but you can vote with a paper ballot.â€
The segment then cuts back to Alan Schulkin in which he makes a racist comment about Muslims.
â€œThey detonate bombs in public schools which weâ€™re using that could disrupt the whole election.â€
The PV journalist responds â€œYeah but they could do it wearing a burka. But then no one could say oh wait let me see your voter ID because they donâ€™t have ID because they donâ€™t want to discriminate because they are wearing a burka.â€
Schulkin responds again agreeing with the journalist â€œexactlyâ€ he says.
She then continues to explain. â€œBut no one can do that because your going to offend them, but then itâ€™s like, hey now, Iâ€™m not a Muslim but I can go in there you know?â€
The video then cuts back to the election official speaking to the PV journalist â€œBut your names not in the book, for some reason itâ€™s not here, but that doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t vote by paper ballot. You just canâ€™t vote by machine.â€ the election official repeats.
â€œOkay so I can vote today by paper ballot?â€ the PV journalist responds.
â€œYes, yes,â€ the election official responds.
The journalist then reiterates that she is voting as Huma Abedin to the official who still hasnâ€™t caught on.
â€œSo I can vote today as Huma Abedin, but just with a paper ballot?â€™
The election official then responds â€œWhatever you want if thatâ€™s you. If thatâ€™s the name you voted with last election, and you havenâ€™t changed your name?â€
â€œOkay Ill be back. Iâ€™m going to go call my husband Anthony.â€ The PV journalist then walks away and is told to â€œcome back laterâ€ by the election official.
The video ends with a final cut back to Alan Schulkin in which he makes the statement, â€œYour vote isnâ€™t really counting because they can go in there with a burka on and you donâ€™t know if they are a voter.â€ He adds, â€œyour vote gets discounted because they come in there with a burka on and they can vote. People think itâ€™s a liberal thing to do, but I take my vote very seriously and I donâ€™t want ten other people coming in negating my vote by voting for the other candidate when theyâ€™re not even registered voters.â€
