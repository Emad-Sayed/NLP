Anderson Cooper is known to be the cool, mild-mannered news host of CNN's AC 360. But the shade he threw on Newt Gingrich after his rant against Megyn Kelly was nothing short of scorching. 
â€œIâ€™m sick and tired of people like you using language thatâ€™s inflammatory, thatâ€™s not true!â€ Gingrich exploded on The Kelly File. â€œWhen you use the words, you took a position. And I think itâ€™s very unfair of you to do that!â€ 
Then, the former Speaker went for the throat: 
â€œYou wanna go back through the tapes of your show recently? You are fascinated with sex and you donâ€™t care about public policy! Thatâ€™s what I get out of watching you tonight!â€ 
Anderson Cooper noticed something unusual about Gingrich's line of attack: 
â€œFor Newt Gingrich to accuse Megyn Kelly of being fascinated by sex,â€ Cooper stated. â€œThis is a guy, whoâ€™s what, on his third marriage, cheated on his first two wives and was having an affair when he was impeaching Bill Clinton. Isnâ€™t that right?â€ 
That's about right. Newt Gingrich admitted to cheating on his first and second wives and having an affair during the Clinton impeachment hearings. 
Watch the segment: 
Trump supporters may not be pleased with the way Megyn Kelly has commented on all of those accusations, and her throwing doubt upon Juanita Broaddrick's rape claims against Bill Clinton did not win her friends in that camp. But love her or hate her, it's not Megyn's job to be the Trump campaign's unofficial spokeswoman. 
It may be her job to assume the role of a news commentator, however, rather than that of an â€œobjectiveâ€ journalist. The idea that there is â€œobjectivityâ€ when it comes to reporting the news is a tired and dangerous cliche the American people should put to rest. 
As for being â€œfascinated by sex,â€ it just might be that Kelly is professionally interested in sexual assault and groping allegations against a presidential candidate, unfounded or otherwise, since the way those are perceived by the public just might sway a national election.
