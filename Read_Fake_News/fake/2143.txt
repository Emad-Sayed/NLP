The Clinton Foundation (Clinton crime cartel) said today â€œooops,we forgot about the 1 million dollars Qatar gave us for Bill Clintonâ€™s birthdayâ€ (my gosh if only I got birthday gifts like that,lol). According to the agreement between the regime and Hillary Clinton while she was SOS all funds given to them from foreign donors had to be cleared by the State Department. Wikileaks exposed the â€œgiftâ€ a while back. And now they are forced to admit it. And figure out a way to â€œexcuseâ€ it. Reply - Share uncle Bob 1 Today 9:25 pm 
To the USâ€™s â€œeternal shameâ€ we now have the choice for President between the â€œsmut talking clownâ€ (Trump) and the â€œcriminal warmongerâ€ (Clinton).I donâ€™t really care too much about Trumpâ€™s antics. But I have kids,and friends,I donâ€™t want dying in neo-con wars.So the choice is totally clear for me. Iâ€™m hoping Trump wins. Though Iâ€™m not holding my breath over that hope. Reply - Share
