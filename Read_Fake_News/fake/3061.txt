Internet security expert Kim Dotcom says that Hillary Clinton is in â€œserious trouble,â€ with new information set to leak that some speculate could be a Wikileaks release of Hillary Clintonâ€™s 33,000 deleted emails.
â€œThereâ€™s unpublished material, yet to come out. Clinton is in serious trouble,â€ the Megaupload founder tweeted last night.
Kim Dotcomâ€™s promise is worthy of attention given his long standing relationship with Wikileaks and Julian Assange. During an interview with Bloomberg in May 2015, Dotcom (real name Kim Schmitz) acknowledged, â€œI love to talk to themâ€.
He also predicted that Julian Assange would be Hillaryâ€™s worst nightmare in 2016 â€œbecause he has access to information,â€ a forecast that very much came true.

This is not the first time that the entrepreneurâ€™s tweets have prompted speculation to swirl. Schmitz has hinted on a number of occasions that Wikileaks is in possession of Hillary Clintonâ€™s 33,000 missing emails.
Last week, Schmitz tweeted at Wikileaks with a video of himself reacting to â€œyouâ€™ve got mailâ€ audio. Hours before, he also sent out another tweet which stated, â€œBleachbit(ch) canâ€™t bleach it,â€ a reference to the software tool used by Hillary to hide traces of her deleted emails.
â€œI know where Hillary Clintons deleted emails are and how to get them legally,â€ Schmitz tweeted on October 27, adding that they â€œare all stored in the NSA spy cloud in Utah.â€

As far back as December 2014, Schmitz also tweeted that he was â€œHillaryâ€™s worst nightmare in 2016!â€
Radio host Rush Limbaugh picked up on the issue during his radio show on Friday, speculating that Kim Dotcom could have been the hacker that handed Hillaryâ€™s deleted emails to Wikileaks.
â€œIn all of these Podesta emails thereâ€™s not a single Hillary Clinton email in the bunch, if you have noticed. Itâ€™s Podesta emailing everybody, the DNC, everybody in the Hillary campaign, but there are no Hillary Clinton emails in this Podesta dump,â€ said Limbaugh.
â€œAlong comes Kim Dotcom whoâ€™s got an axe to grind with the U.S. government, the Obama administration. He knows Assange. So the people â€” nobody knows â€” this is all speculation. Whatâ€™s going on here is that Kim Dotcom has worked with Assange and is really the hacker. Itâ€™s not the Russians,â€ he added.
Is Kim Dotcom working with Wikileaks to release Hillaryâ€™s 33,000 deleted emails right before the election?
If itâ€™s going to happen, it has to happen this week.
