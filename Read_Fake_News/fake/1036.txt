Senate Democrats To FBI: Put Up Or Shut Up About Emails (TWEETS) By Darrell Lucus on October 30, 2016 Subscribe 
If there was any doubt that FBI Director James Comeyâ€™s announcement that the FBI was reviewing potential evidence in the Hillary Clinton email affair backfired spectacularly, it was erased on Saturday night. Four top Senate Democrats gave Comey an ultimatum â€“give us a full accounting of what you know about this, and do so by Monday. 
Senators Dianne Feinstein, Patrick Leahy, Tom Carper, and Ben Cardin fired off a â€œwhat the hell is going on here?â€ letter to Comey and his nominal boss, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, demanding answers about Comeyâ€™s â€œvaguely wordedâ€ letter on Friday afternoon. They are the ranking members of the Senate committees that were most involved in the email server investigationâ€“Intelligence (Feinstein), Judiciary (Leahy), Homeland Security (Carper), and Foreign Relations (Cardin).

In a colossal understatement, they pointed out that the letter didnâ€™t answer any questions, but in fact left a lot of them unanswered. For one thing, Comeyâ€™s letter didnâ€™t clarify whether the FBI even had the emails in its custody, let alone had a chance to review them. Comey also didnâ€™t say whether Hillary sent the emails, or if they even had anything to do with the investigation. Additionally, it represented a radical departure from FBI and Justice Department policy against doing anything that could potentially influence an election. 
The Senators also noted that Comey had told his own troops that he didnâ€™t know just how significant those emails were, and that there was a possibility that his letter would be â€œmisunderstood.â€ In light of the fact that this letter has already been misunderstood, Feinstein, Carper, Leahy, and Cardin want Comey and Lynchâ€“in truth, Comeyâ€“to give the Senate â€œdetailed informationâ€ about the FBIâ€™s actions no later than the close of business on Monday. To not do so, they add, â€œwould be irresponsible and a disservice to the American people.â€ 
There were already a number of reasons why Comey should be very afraid. For one thing, at the time, the FBI had not even obtained a warrant for the emails it discovered on the laptop of longtime Hillary aide Huma Abedin while investigating her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, for inappropriate texts with a teenager. So Comey felt the need to alert the House and Senate about these emails, when his people hadnâ€™t even asked a court to review them. 
We also know that Comeyâ€™s rumored excuseâ€“that the emails were likely to be leaked unless he told Congress about them firstâ€“doesnâ€™t wash. Judge Jeanine Pirro , no fan of Hillary, thinks Comey could have easily solved that problem by privately notifying the committee chairmen and putting them on notice that he would know who was behind any leaks. 
But on Sunday afternoon, The Washington Post reported that the FBI hadnâ€™t gotten a warrant for those emails despite knowing for at least a month that those messages were potentially relevant to the email server case. It finally obtained a warrant on Sunday night. How is Comey going to explain that to the Senate, especially since he knew how explosive this could have been? 
Itâ€™s no wonder that Comeyâ€™s own troops are steaming mad at him, according to Newsweek and Vanity Fairâ€™s Kurt Eichenwald. Hereâ€™s what Eichenwald has learned, by way of review. Word from inside @FBI . FURIOUS at Comey, think he's mishandled public revelations from get go. "Outrageous incompetence" one agent told me. 
â€” Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 â€¦his original decision to lay out info on clinton case, then opine on what it meant outside of criminal findings, infuriated these folks.. 
â€” Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 Re: anger within @FBI at Comey. I am getting this at the Special Agent, ASAC and SAC level. Those are the troops. (Most of em GOPrs)â€¦. 
â€” Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 â€¦for Comey to have so angered ppl at the field office level is really, really bad. 
â€” Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 If Comey's improper comment on ongoing investigation changes polls, @FBI reputation as apolitical will never recover cause of his screwup.

While Feinstein, Leahy, Carper, and Cardin played good cop, their boss, Minority Leader Harry Reid, played bad cop, accusing Comey of breaking the Hatch Act . I wouldnâ€™t quite go that far. But when the best-case scenario is that Comey was grossly incompetent, that isnâ€™t good. 
Comeyâ€™s actions may not have risen to the level of criminal conduct. However, it is clear beyond any doubt that he cannot lead. Eichenwald has talked to a number of DOJ officials from both parties who feel the same way. Every current/former Dept. of Justice official I speak 2, GOP or Dem, says Comey must resign/be fired 4 election interference. All outraged.

Unless Comey has a very good explanation for thisâ€“and frankly, I doubt there is oneâ€“we need to hear only two things from him after he briefs the Senate. He needs to apologize to the American people, and he needs to resign.
