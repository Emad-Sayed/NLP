Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Lucas Wilde America gives Grand Piano to horse 
America has given a grand piano to a horse and is expecting some quality tunes. 
â€œIâ€™m particularly looking forward to Beethovenâ€™s Ninth,â€ beamed horse supporter and piano enthusiast, Jay Cooper. 
â€œA horse has never been given a piano before because, frankly, the establishment wouldnâ€™t allow it. 
â€œNow, at last, change has come, and America will change for the better. 
â€œThere are a lot of doubters out there, and those doubters will soon be silenced by the graceful notes of Chopin, Mozart and maybe even Little Richard.â€ 
Horse, Dobbin Williams, said, â€œIâ€™m not really sure whatâ€™s expected of me here. 
â€œIâ€™m a horse. I am absolutely not qualified to play a piano. 
â€œI meanâ€¦ Look at these hooves and the way I am in general. I canâ€™t even sit on the chair properly. 
â€œWhy on earth did anyone think this was a good idea?â€ 
Cooper grinned, â€œWe did it. Weâ€™ve made pianos great again.â€ 
Democrat, Elizabeth King, said â€œWe wanted to get a pianist of low-to-medium standard for the piano. 
â€œShe wouldnâ€™t have thumped out anything exciting, but it would have been perfectly reasonable background music. 
â€œBut the people have spoken, and the people wanted a horse.
