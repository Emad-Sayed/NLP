This is just too rich! The FBI agreed to destroy the laptops that Clinton and her aides turned over during the EmailGate investigationâ€¦ and then agents REFUSED to do it. Now, the laptops have been subpoenaed and the FBI is just waiting for Congress to ask for them. Oh goody! All that evidence is about to come back into play along with Weinerâ€™s laptop that has over 10,000 emails of Humaâ€™s dealings with Hillary Clinton. Good times. Stick a fork in themâ€¦ Iâ€™d say they may just be about done. 
Washington D.C. attorney Joe DiGenova is the one that broke this explosive revelation. Hillary Clinton must be having multiple panic attacks right about now. I guess we are going to see just how well her health holds up over her corruption being exposed. I understand that she looks dead tired over all this. Iâ€™ll bet. Her lies are finally beginning to catch up with her. They should have long ago. 
From The Daily Caller: 
Agents within the Federal Bureau of Investigation never destroyed laptops given to them by aides of Hillary Clinton as previously reported , a Washington D.C. lawyer with a source close to the Clinton investigation says. 
Washington D.C. attorney Joe DiGenova said on The David Webb Show on SiriusXM Friday night that despite the FBI agreeing to destroy the laptops of Clinton aide Cheryl Mills and ex-campaign staffer Heather Samuelson as part of immunity deals made during the initial investigation of Clintonâ€™s email server, agents involved in the case refused to destroy the laptops. 
â€œAccording to the agreement reached with the attorneys who handed over their laptops, the laptops were to be destroyed per the agreement after the testimony was given â€“the interviews were given â€“ â€“ by the attorneys. The bureau and the department agreed to that,â€ DiGenova said. â€œHowever the laptops contrary to published reports were not destroyed and the reason is the agents who are tasked with destroying them refused to do so. And by the way the laptops are at the FBI for inspection by Congress or federal courts.â€ 
DiGenova said the laptops have already been subpoenaed and the FBI is waiting for Congress to ask for them. 
Iâ€™m sure Donald Trump is all smiles over these developments. In the end, Hillary Clinton was her own worst enemy and Donald Trumpâ€™s biggest supporter in this election. 
â€œWhen I found out last Sunday that those laptops â€” by the way from somebody who is involved in the investigation by the FBIâ€“ had not been destroyed contrary to published reports, I could not believe that the Republicans had not gotten their hands on them even yet,â€ DiGenova said. Neither can Iâ€¦ come on GOPâ€¦ youâ€™ve just been handed the keys to the kingdom here. Time to go in for the kill. Donâ€™t blow it this time. Related Items Terresa Monroe-Hamilton
