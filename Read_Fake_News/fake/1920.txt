We all know by now that the Clinton campaign will stop at nothing to win. 
Even if it means publishing embarrassing, demeaning photos of fellow Democrats, thatâ€™s just fine with them. 
Evidenced a photo that was circulated showing Bernie Sanders in a swimming suit apparently attending a Democratic retreat. This was all while the Clinton team was hyping stories about Sanders attending fundraisers for wealthy benefactors (which, letâ€™s be honest, pales in comparison to the â€œ wealthy benefactorsâ€ Hillary has in her back pocket). 
Breitbart reported that Tina Flournoy, Bill Clintonâ€™s Chief of staff emailed the photo of Sanders sunning himself by a pool to Brian Fallon and John Podesta, two Clinton lackeys: 
Fallonâ€™s response? â€œOMG!â€ 
â€œCan we tweet?â€ Podesta asked. 
Fallon responded â€œI think we shd give to NY post.â€ Flournoy added sheâ€™d send more juicy details about the event, including the people who attended. 
â€œThank you,â€ Fallon replied. â€œ We are on this .â€ 
The entire conversation was part of the ongoing WikiLeaks document hacks of John Podestaâ€™s account. The New York Post apparently never ran with the story, but that didnâ€™t stop the Clinton camp from sending it to other people. It was published by celebrity gossip dirtbag Perez Hilton the day after the Clinton team discussed releasing it. 
â€œI wonder what Mike Bloomberg would think about this???â€ wrote Hilton on his blog. â€œBernie Sanders lounges at elite Marthaâ€™s Vineyard pool, summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists.â€ 
Just the next week, there were several stories in the media questioning Sanders for even attending the fundraiser for Harry Reid. 
â€œFor Sanders, campaign finance purity not always possibleâ€ wrote MSNBCâ€™s Alex Seitz-Wald, citing â€œa guest list obtained by MSNBCâ€ that included â€œpreviously unreported are details about who exactly attended those fundraisers.â€ 
â€œBernie Sanders: Prolific Democratic Party fundraiser,â€ wrote CNNâ€™s Eric Bradner on Monday, February 8, announcing that â€œCNN has obtained invitations that listed Sanders as a host for at least one Majority Trust event in each year since 2011.â€ 
Then both Bill and Hillary picked up on those same media stories, accusing Sanders of taking Wall Street money â€“ the height of hypocrisy. 
â€œSenator Sanders took about $200,000 from Wall Street firms,â€ Hillary Clinton said during a rally in New Hampshire on February 8. â€œNot directly but through the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. There is nothing wrong with that. It didnâ€™t change his view. Well, it didnâ€™t change my view or my vote, either.â€ 
Bill Clinton attacked Sanders, referring directly to the CNN story and pointing out that he likely accepted money from Wall Street. 
And thatâ€™s how Hillary Clinton wins. By Any Means Necessary.
