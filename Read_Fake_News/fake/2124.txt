From Hillary Clinton on the electric chair to African-American effigies hung from trees , Trump supporters are clearly very passionate about their lawn displays. Add to the list a 56 year-old Michigan Man who is now facing felony weapons charges after holding six children â€“ ages 12 to 14 â€“ at gunpoint and forcing them to the ground for allegedly knocking down his Trump yard sign. 
Thatâ€™s right. The kids were terrorized at gun point over a Trump yard sign. 
Michael Kubek, 56, of Allen Park, MI, said that he was angry at the children because he believed they had â€vandalizedâ€™ his Trump sign, although he hadnâ€™t actually seen them do it. The children told the police that they were simply walking to a local park when an unhinged Kubek â€œpulled out a pistol and ordered them to sit down on a neighborâ€™s lawn.â€ In any case, it appears that the â€vandalismâ€™ consisted in the sign simply being knocked down â€“ perhaps Kubek should take out his anger on the wind â€“ and the children were reportedly â€œtraumatizedâ€ by the experience. 
When police, who were called to the scene by Kubekâ€™s mother, arrived, they found the children lying on the grass with Kubek â€œstanding over them yelling and cursing.â€ The children said he had pointed a gun at them and a neighbor described Kubek using â€œvery profane language.â€ According to local news channel Fox 2, â€œthe kids said they tried to tell Kubek they did not damage his sign, but it only resulted with Kubek telling them to shut up and continue cursing at them.â€ 
Kubek claims he felt â€œthreatenedâ€ because he was â€œoutnumberedâ€ by the adolescents and invoked his second amendment right. Luckily, he was arrested by local police and had his gun confiscated â€” although he has now been released on a $5,000 bail. 
Just another day in Trumpâ€™s America, folks. Hopefully, the nightmare will be over soonâ€¦
