Taming the corporate media beast Biden Doesn't Stand a Chance. Clinton's Secretary of State Will Be Vicky Nuland Originally appeared at The American Conservative 
Joe Biden is reportedly being considered for Secretary of State in a Clinton administration: 
Joe Biden is at the top of the internal short list Hillary Clintonâ€™s transition team is preparing for her pick to be secretary of state, a source familiar with the planning tells POLITICO. 
If Biden is on such a list, I doubt he is at the top of it, and my guess is that he wouldnâ€™t be the nominee in any case. There are other likely choices, including Victoria Nuland, that would be a better fit with Clinton and would be even more likely to share her foreign policy priorities. Kelley Vlahos reported earlier this year on Nulandâ€™s record: 
Where will Victoria Nuland be after January? Nuland is one of Hillary Clintonâ€™s prot©g©s at the State Department, and she is also greatly admired by hardline Republicans. This suggests she would be easily approved by Congress as secretary of state or maybe even national-security adviserâ€”which in turn suggests that her foreign-policy views deserve a closer look. 
If Nuland can be considered a Clinton protege, Biden is more of a rival. During the first Obama term, Biden and Clinton were frequently on opposing sides of internal foreign policy debates, and in his 2015 announcement that he wouldnâ€™t run for president Biden offered what I took to be a rebuke of Clintonâ€™s more aggressive foreign policy positioning: 
We have to accept the fact that we canâ€™t solve all of the worldâ€™s problems. We canâ€™t solve many of them alone. 
The argument that we just have to do something when bad people do bad things isnâ€™t good enough. Itâ€™s not a good enough reason for American intervention and to put our sons and daughtersâ€™ lives on the line, put them at risk. 
Probably their most significant disagreement was over intervention in Libya: Clinton was a major supporter, and Biden saw no compelling reason for the U.S. to intervene. Biden has a fairly hawkish record over the last twenty years, but even he couldnâ€™t see why the U.S. should get involved there. As recently as June, he was publicly claiming vindication for opposing an intervention that Clinton touts as â€œsmart power at its best.â€ I donâ€™t see why she would want Biden as her Secretary of State, and I definitely donâ€™t see why he would want to serve in her administration.
