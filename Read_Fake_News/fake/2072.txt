Tuesday 8 November 2016 Daily Mail forced to lie down in darkened room after confirmation Prince Harryâ€™s girlfriend is mixed-race 
The Daily Mail has been forced to go and lie down in a darkened room for a while after learning that Prince Harryâ€™s new girlfriend is one of those â€brown onesâ€™. 
Doctors were called after the newspaper reported feeling faint at reading the Kensington Palace statement confirming the relationship. 
The Daily Mail explained, â€œI know weâ€™ve been reporting the relationship for days, but weâ€™d hoped against hope it wasnâ€™t really true. 
â€œSure, weâ€™ve trawled her entire career and social feeds going back years to find video clips and photos that might make her look unsuitable as a girlfriend for a member of our royal family, all without ever saying itâ€™s just because sheâ€™s a brown foreigner â€“ but you kinda knew that, right? 
â€œI mean, we canâ€™t just say we donâ€™t like her because sheâ€™s brown and foreign. Otherwise, weâ€™d probably find our editor Paul Dacre being reported to himself in his other role at the Press Complaints Commission. That wouldnâ€™t be good for anyone. 
â€œBut now itâ€™s bloody well confirmed sheâ€™s definitely going out with him, and.. wellâ€¦ oh hear, Iâ€™m coming over all faint again. 
â€œDo you realise that any child they might have would be 6th in line to the throne?! Can you imagine, a BROWN king!!â€ 
At that point the doctors asked us to leave so they could administer an emergency sedative.
