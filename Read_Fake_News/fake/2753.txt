Our bad-tempered behaviour is not a cry for help, say old men 15-10-14 ELDERLY men have warned the public not to try making friends with them. As it emerged that many men will spend their declining years alone, aged males confirmed that beneath their crusty, irascible exterior there was only more irascibility. 79-year-old Roy Hobbs said: â€œSome people seem to think that when I tell them to fuck off I actually mean â€I crave companionship, come and have some cakeâ€™. â€œWhat I actually mean is â€fuck offâ€™. â€œI spent most of my middle years hiding alone in a shed. Now Iâ€™m a widower and the kids have left home I can at last come in the house, because thereâ€™s nobody else in it.â€ Hobbs warned especially against anyone trying to pick him up in a minibus and take him to some kind of community centre. â€œIâ€™ve got a small hostile dog and a cupboard full of Fray Bentos pies and I am fine with that.â€
