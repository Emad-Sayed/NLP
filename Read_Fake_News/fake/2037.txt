Harvard Cancels Menâ€™s Soccer Season After Finding Sexually Explicit â€Reportsâ€™ Continued Through 2016 Andrew M. Duehren et al., Harvard Crimson, November 3, 2016 
Harvard has cancelled the menâ€™s soccer teamâ€™s season after an Office of General Counsel review found that the team continued to produce vulgar and explicit documents rating women on their perceived sexual appeal and physical appearance. 
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in an email to Harvard student athletes that he decided to cancel the rest of the teamâ€™s season because the â€œpractice appears to be more widespread across the team and has continued beyond 2012, including in 2016.â€ 
â€œAs a direct result of what Harvard Athletics has learned, we have decided to cancel the remainder of the 2016 menâ€™s soccer season,â€ Scalise wrote. â€œThe team will forfeit its remaining games and will decline any opportunity to achieve an Ivy League championship or to participate in the NCAA Tournament this year.â€ 
Last week, The Crimson reported that the 2012 menâ€™s soccer team created a â€œscouting reportâ€ of that yearâ€™s womenâ€™s soccer recruits, rating them numerically and assigning each a hypothetical sexual position. University President Drew G. Faust instructed OGC, Harvardâ€™s team of lawyers, to â€œreviewâ€ the matter.

â€œThe decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential, and reflects Harvardâ€™s view that both the teamâ€™s behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable, have no place at Harvard, and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community,â€ Faust wrote in a statement. 
Faust wrote she â€œwas deeply distressed to learn that the appalling actions of the 2012 menâ€™s soccer team were not isolated to one year or the actions of a few individuals.â€

Last week, when Scalise first saw the documentsâ€”which were, until recently, publicly accessible through the 2012 teamâ€™s Google Groupâ€”he said he would immediately reach out to coaches of both menâ€™s and womenâ€™s teams to discuss the report, but added that any response should be internal to Harvard and â€œnot a media thing.â€

Menâ€™s soccer coach Pieter S. Lehrer wrote in a statement that the team is â€œbeyond disappointed that our season has ended in this way, but we respect the decision made by our administration.â€
