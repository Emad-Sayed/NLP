Iâ€™m voting for him â€“ but will be very quiet about it. 
I believe there Are many out there who are doing the same. Islam is not gay-friendly. Itâ€™s the leftist idiot who would believe that it is despite a mountain of evidence showing the truth about Islam. 
However â€“ too many follow the company line. It is getting very demanding these days, and frankly very strange. But doesnâ€™t the left always do that? Whatever problem there is within the right â€“ at least there is enough room, and more than the case now with the left. Well â€“ at least for this â€cisâ€™ white male.

As a gay man I despair of my fellow gays. Here in the UK most have this â€œpoor refugeeâ€ mentality. By time the penny finally drops it will be too late BareNakedIslam October 27, 2016 @ 12:34 pm 
Andy, while the majority still have that â€œpoor refugeeâ€ mentality, I have seen a number of gay people commenting here and/or emailing me who know the truth. Theyâ€™re just afraid of the ridicule they will get by talking about it in within their liberal circles. Manual Paleologos October 27, 2016 @ 10:56 am 
The irony is that the LGBTQWERTY community is almost uniformly liberal. They support the people who are stoning them, throwing them from buildings, and hanging them. They have ceded any influence with the political Right, as no matter what the Right does, they will not get any meaningful Gay support. That means that just or unjust, there is absolutely no upside to supporting Gay issues. There is a small upside from the Christian Right, to pissing on them. 
Meanwhile, although we disagree on some major issues, we are probably their best friends. We are the people who would die to protect them.
