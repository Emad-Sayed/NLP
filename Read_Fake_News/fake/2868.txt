Unit tests are a wonderful tool for proving that your code works. Ideally, when youâ€™re using other code, like say, the .NET Framework, you donâ€™t write tests that test the framework itself. After all, didnâ€™t Microsoft already do that? 
David T â€™s co-worker laughs at your na¯vet© . Why would you trust Microsoft ? You need to make sure the framework works as advertised. Which is why their unit tests are mostly made up of code like this: [Test] public void It_Converts_DataType_Text_Into_ConcreteType() { const string dataTypeText = "System.DateTime"; var dataType = Type.GetType(dataTypeText); Assert.IsTrue(dataType == typeof(DateTime)); } [Test] public void It_Converts_String_Into_Given_DataType() { const string data = "10-10-2014"; const string dataTypeText = "System.DateTime"; var dataType = Type.GetType(dataTypeText); object newData = Convert.ChangeType(data, dataType); Assert.That(newData, Is.TypeOf<DateTime>()); } 
Now, if the .NET Frameworkâ€™s ability to load and recognize types ever breaks, Davidâ€™s team will be the first to know.
