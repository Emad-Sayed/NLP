Michelle Obama Promotes Lewd Rappers
From Gerald Celenteâ€™s Trend Alert
Michelle Obamaâ€™s â€rapâ€™ more disgusting than Trump talk
KINGSTON, NY, 26 October 2016â€”Hitting the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, Michelle Obama made headline news lashing out at Donald Trumpâ€™s boast on a 2005 tape that as a star he could â€œdo anything to women.â€ Calling Trumpâ€™s statements so â€œshocking and demeaningâ€ that â€œI canâ€™t stop thinking about this; it has shaken to me to my core,â€ Ms. Obama said she was campaigning against â€œhateful language about women.â€ 
Ms. Obama also chastised Mr. Trump for â€œspeaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior,â€ and â€œusing language so obscene that many of us were worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV.â€ 
Bad Rap
While Trumpâ€™s statements were offensive to women, they pale in comparison to the loud chorus of rappersâ€™ filth and denigration of women that Michelle and Barack Obama have continually promoted, championed, wined and dined at the White House. And, while she has condemned Trumpâ€™s lewd remarks â€“ including how â€œloving fathers are sickened by the thought of their daughters being exposed to this kind of vicious languageâ€ â€“ the Obamas have hosted in the â€œThe Peopleâ€™s House,â€ where their two daughters reside, rappers who obscenely rap about date rape and sexual predatory behavior.
Indeed, it is not the presidential race that â€œlittle girlsâ€ are tuned into to hear â€œabout who they should look like, how they should act,â€ or hearing â€œlanguage so obscene that many of us worry about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV,â€ as Obama claimed in her speech. Young people are not watching TV with mommy and daddy. They tune into the music/entertainment world that promotes â€œhateful language about womenâ€ performed by White House guest rappers such as:
Rick Ross, â€œU.O.E.N.O.â€
Put Molly all in her champagne, she ainâ€™t even know it
I took her home and I enjoyed that, she ainâ€™t even know itâ€¦
(Molly is a street name for ecstasy, a â€love drugâ€™) 
Big Sean, â€œMona Lisaâ€ 
I believe in God and rubbers
Even if we sex you are not my lover
Hit you on the couch and not the covers 
And if you bring you friend then we got to f#ck herâ€¦
When they go low, we go high
Beyond the rappers, Michelle Obama also has elevated Beyonce´ â€“ a performer who dresses and dances in sync with her sexually explicit lyric library â€“ as a â€œrole model for young girls around the world,â€ and is â€œproud to have my daughter grow up in a world where she has people like you, to look up to.â€
Thus, while the first lady continually brags about raising the moral bar of integrity while condemning Trumpâ€™s words and deeds, the media have ignored the far greater of two evils: The blatant hypocrisy of Michelle Obama, who supports a deplorable, debased entertainment industry drenched in debauchery that is poisoning the planet.
