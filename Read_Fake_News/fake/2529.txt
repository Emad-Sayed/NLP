The recent George Soros hacks show plans/conspiracy to subvert Russiaâ€™s traditional values. 
George Sorosâ€™ Open Societyâ€™s Foundation is responsible for funding many â€œcivil rights organizationâ€ that promote â€œWestern valuesâ€ in Russia. 
Soros is one of the 30 richest people in the world, known for supporting Cultural Marxist organizations around the world, using his billion dollar wealth to wield enormous influence in society.

â€œOur inclination is to engage in activities that will â€¦ counter Russian support to movements defending traditional valuesâ€ 
The language in Sorosâ€™ internal communication read as if his Foundation sees itself as a full-scale warrior in a global conflict, â€œthe stakes are highâ€, and â€œwe should avoid entering directly into the geo-strategic warfareâ€¦â€
