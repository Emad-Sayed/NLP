RATHER than relax and play Texas Hold â€Em with his friends as they had a few cans after a recent night out, hardcore culchie Noel Kennelan desperatley attempted to explain the impenetrable rules of the card game â€™25â€™, which he claims is â€way better than poker, hiâ€™. 
25, also known as â€that culchie gameâ€™, involves the dealing of 5 cards to each player and the reveal of a trump card, followed by at least 10 minutes of explaining how the 2 of spades can beat the 9 of diamonds if spades were lead with, and diamonds arenâ€™t trump. 
Kennelan, 28, made great efforts to explain to the 6 other men around the table of his Dublin flat the baffling rules of â€stealingâ€™ and â€renegingâ€™, but in the end had to concede that the game was too complex and the players were too drunk to fully wrap their heads around it. 
â€œAfter the nightclub, back to the house, few cans, the cards come out,â€ said Kennelan, dealing himself a solemn hand of Patience. 
â€œThe lads all play poker, but 25 is where itâ€™s at. Way more skill, you can win a hand with nothing if you play it right. But the lads just couldnâ€™t get to grips with the fingersâ€. 
Kennelan later went online to see if there were any culchies in the area who were looking to play 25, and is considering setting up a club or something where they can go and drink Smithwicks and play cards and complain about Dublin.
