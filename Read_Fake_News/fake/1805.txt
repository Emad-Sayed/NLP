There isnâ€™t a single parent alive, famous or not, that doesnâ€™t fear for their childrenâ€™s health and safety. None of us ever wants to confront the reality that one of our kids is sick, but thatâ€™s just what singer Michael Bubl© and his wife, Luisana, are facing. 
Their eldest son, Noah, was just diagnosed with cancer. Heâ€™s just three years old. 
The family were dealt the tragic blow after the youngster visited doctors with a suspected case of mumps , Argentinian website La Nacion reports . 
â€œTheyâ€™re staying positive and Noah is a fighter.â€ 
Argentinian journalist Tomas Dente read out a text message from Daniela on a morning TV show which said: â€œTo tell you the truth Iâ€™m devastated. This is very recent. 
â€œThe only thing I ask is that you donâ€™t speculate because not everyone has children and can understand what this means. 
A story on Buzzfeed shares the coupleâ€™s statement, in which the singer asks for privacy as he and his family fight this battle. 
According to BuzzFeed , the Argentinian newspaper La Nacion reported that Noah was initially taken to the doctor for a suspected case of the mumps and was subsequently diagnosed with cancer, every parentâ€™s worst nightmare. 
As Bubl© said in his post, â€œWe are devastated about the recent cancer diagnosis of our oldest son Noah who is currently undergoing treatment in the US. We have always been very vocal about the importance of family and the love we have for our children.â€ A photo posted by Michael Bubl© (@michaelbuble) on Oct 16, 2016 at 7:25am PDT 
It seems clear that this isnâ€™t a family that will take this situation lying down. Noahâ€™s cancer is in for a fight. 
The battle wonâ€™t be easy, especially since childhood cancer research is woefully underfunded. The St Baldrickâ€™s Foundation states that only 4% of cancer research is devoted to childhood cancer, despite the fact that, according to Dr. Eugenie Kleinerman, head of the division of pediatrics at the Childrenâ€™s Cancer Hospital at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, â€œCuring childhood cancer is the equivalent of curing breast cancer in terms of productive life years saved.â€ 
Bubl© and his wife are putting their careers on hold to tend to their son, and expressing hope that, with the â€œsupport of family, friends and fans around the world, we will win this battle, God willing.â€ 
Recently, the singer had expressed his joy at being a dad, telling Entertainment Tonight , â€œThe only regret that I have in my life is that I took this long to have kids, because I had no idea the perspective it would give me. I had no idea how much I would love being a dad.â€ 
And now he has to face that hardest battle any parent could imagine. Hopefully, that love will be enough, and his son will pull through. Vanquishing Viruses â€“ 10 Natural Antiviral Remedies
