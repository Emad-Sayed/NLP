Distracted by suffering refugees, confused by convoluted Brexit negotiations or just plain scared by a Trump presidency? No? Neither is your Prime Minster. Today Theresa May did what every true leader does in a crisis â€“ which is to turn everyoneâ€™s attention to meaningless ephemera; like poppies, Grammar Schools and who should present the new â€Bake-offâ€™? 
Taking a break from quashing the Orgreave Inquiry, Mrs May said FIFAâ€™s stance of not politicizing sport was â€outrageousâ€™. A spokeswoman explained: â€In these times of austerity, we need cheap, meaningless gestures accompanied by hollow outrage. If over-paid under-achieving footballers are not allowed to wear a poppy â€“ then the terrorists have won. Itâ€™s a known fact that Afghan jihadists fear the poppyâ€¦although admittedly 80% of their income is based on the opium tradeâ€¦umâ€¦erâ€¦I may not have thought this throughâ€¦â€™ 
Armed police are expected to patrol our streets, opening fire on anyone not wearing a poppy or failing to whistle the tune from â€The Dambustersâ€™. A Police Inspector remarked: â€We may be perpetuating a mawkishly sentimental view of war but donâ€™t think for a second you can get away with recycling last yearâ€™s poppy â€“ weâ€™re wise to that dodge!â€™ 
Without a doubt this is the most important issue of 2016 â€“ whether 22 footballers can wear poppies for 90 minutes in a stadium filled with 60,000 people wearing poppies. Some cynics have suggested Theresa Mayâ€™s use of misdirection in these troubled times, is the political equivalent of David Copperfield pulling an elephant out his arse. Her spokeswoman countered: â€The important thing is to remember those who sacrificed their lives in warâ€“ rather than the reasons behind it or making sure it never happens againâ€™.
