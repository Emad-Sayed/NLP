Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/soros-paid-al-gore-millions-to-push.html Liberal billionaire George Soros gave former Vice President Al Goreâ€™s environmental group millions of dollars over three years to create a â€œpolitical space for aggressive U.S. actionâ€ on global warming, according to leaked documents. A document published by DC Leaks shows Soros, a Hungarian-born liberal financier, wanted his nonprofit Open Society Institute (OSI) to do more to support global warming policies in the U.S. That included budgeting $10 million in annual support to Goreâ€™s climate group over three years.â€œU.S. Programs Global Warming Grants U.S. Programs became engaged on the global warming issue about four years ago, at George Sorosâ€™s suggestion,â€ reads a leaked OSI memo.â€œThere has been a budget of $11 million for global warming grants in the U.S. Programs budget for the last several years,â€ the memo reads. â€œThis budget item captures George Sorosâ€™s commitment of $10 million per year for three years to Al Goreâ€™s Alliance for Climate Protection, which conducts public education on the climate issue in pursuit of creating political space for aggressive U.S. action in line with what scientists say is necessary to put our nation on a path to reducing its outsize carbon dioxide emissions.â€Itâ€™s unclear what year the memo was sent, but the Gore co-founded Alliance for Climate Protection (ACP) was established in 2006 and lasted until it became The Climate Reality Project in July 2011. In 2008, the Alliance launched a $300 million campaign to encourage â€œAmericans to push for aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,â€ The Washington Post reported . Global Warming is NOT caused by humans: 10 Prominent Scientists Refuting 'Manmade Global Warming' with Solid Research ACP got $10 million from the Open Society Institute (OSI) in 2008, according to the nonprofitâ€™s tax filings. OSI handed over another $5 million to ACP in 2009, according to tax filings. The investigative reporting group ProPublica keeps a database that has OSI tax returns from 2000 to 2013. TheDCNF could not find other years where OSI gave money to ACP.OSI is primarily a grant-making nonprofit that hands out millions of dollars every year to mostly left-wing causes. Now called the Open Society Foundations, Sorosâ€™s nonprofit has handed out more than $13 billion over the last three decades.OSI didnâ€™t only plan to fund Goreâ€™s climate group to promote global warming policies in the U.S., OSI also planned on giving millions of dollars to spur the â€œyouth climate movement.â€ Greenpeace Founder: Humans Not to Blame for Global Warming â€œThis budget item also allows for the renewal of U.S. Programsâ€™ long-standing support of the Energy Action Coalition, which is the lead organizer of the youth climate movement in the U.S., the memo reads.â€œWe are also including a placeholder for an additional $2 million, pending discussion about and development of OSIâ€™s global warming agenda,â€ the memo reads. â€œThere is a memo from Nancy Youman in the strategic plans binder that recommends pathways forward for OSI on the climate issue â€“ in the U.S., as well as in other parts of the Open Society Network.â€ By Michael Bastasch
