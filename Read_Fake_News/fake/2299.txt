Email US President Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton â€œfoundedâ€ the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group in the Middle East region, according to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Addressing supporters at a rally in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump said Daesh is "honoring President Obama." â€œHeâ€™s the founder of ISIS. He's the founder! He founded ISIS,â€ the real estate tycoon said, using an alternative acronym for the terrorist group. â€œI would say the co-founder would be â€Crookedâ€™ Hillary Clinton,â€ Trump added. He went on to criticize Obamaâ€™s decision to withdraw American military forces from Iraq and leaving behind a void for Daesh terrorists to fill. â€œWe should never have gotten out the way we got out,â€ he said. â€œWe unleashed terrible fury all over the Middle East." â€œInstead of allowing some small forces behind to maybe, just maybe, keep it under control, we pulled it out,â€ he continued. Daesh terrorists, many of whom were initially trained by the CIA in Jordan in 2012 to destabilize the Syrian government, still control parts of Iraq and Syria. They have been engaged in crimes against humanity in areas under their control. They have been carrying out horrific acts of violence such as public decapitations and crucifixions against all communities, including Shia and Sunni Muslims, Kurds, and Christians. In a statement last week, Mike Pence, Trumpâ€™s vice presidential candidate, also said that the policies of Obama and Clinton led to the rise of Daesh. He blamed Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the â€œdisastrous decisionsâ€ that led to the death of Captain Humayun Khan in Iraq. On July 28, Captain Khanâ€™s father, Khizr Khan, addressed the Democratic National Convention, denouncing Trump as unpatriotic and selfish over his statements against immigrants and Muslims.
