Famous techno musician Moby tore into Republican nominee Donald Trump today in an op-ed published in RollingStone magazine, tearing into the racist rabble-rouser with unrepentant fury. â€œIâ€™m tired of being a mealy-mouthed, NPR-listening lefty who has to respect other peopleâ€™s opinionsâ€ writes Moby. â€œTrump is an actual sociopath.â€ 
Distraught at the unrelenting vitriol being hurled at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Moby disparages the naivete with which he feels many voters are approaching the election. 
If you have a 25-year-old whoâ€™s a Jill Stein supporter but they were nine when Ralph Nader handed the presidency to George W. Bush, they donâ€™t know better. There are a lot of people who have lived in a relatively benign bubble, like young women who just assume that Roe v. Wade will always be the law of the land. I think that thereâ€™s an innocence that is informing a lot of peopleâ€™s desire not to vote, or to vote for Jill Stein, but itâ€™s because theyâ€™ve had eight years of Obama. And I think that that innocence is making some of them naive and delusional. 
He then goes on to detail just why a Donald Trump presidency is enough of a threat for him to be so undiplomatic in his approach. 
I think there is something seriously broken inside him where heâ€™s an actual sociopath and on the spectrum pretty close to being a psychopath. Heâ€™s done nothing to indicate that heâ€™s even capable of feeling empathy [for anyone] except for himself. 
[A Trump presidency would be] death by 1,000 Republican cuts. It basically gives the NRA the ability to write gun policy. It gives the coal industry and the oil industry the ability to write energy policy. Itâ€™s handing the keys to people who want to advance policy measures that are just â€” again, I try and be diplomatic, but theyâ€™re trying to advance policy measures to protect their corporate interests or protect their personal interests but to the egregious detriment of our country. 
With Trump, you get a belligerent racist whoâ€™s most likely a sociopath [and] definitely a racist and misogynist with no governing experience. And with Hillary, you get an incredibly bright, progressive, strong, experienced legislator. Thereâ€™s no choice unless youâ€™re ignorant, delusional or racist. 
Heâ€™s absolutely right on that point. While the â€œdeath by 1,000 Republican cutsâ€ is the threat posed by any Republican candidate for the Presidency, the figure of Donald Trump is a threat to our Republic as we know it, and there can be only one choice. 
Iâ€™ve given more money to Democrats this cycle than Iâ€™ve ever given in an election season. Iâ€™ve done phone-banking, tweeted, Facebooked and Instagrammed, probably to my own personal detriment â€” the detriment of my friendships [and] certainly the detriment of my professional life â€“ but honestly, the results of this election are more important than most. Iâ€™d rather lose fans and have a hand in trying to keep Donald Trump out of the White House than trying to protect a career. A career pales in comparison to the health and wellbeing of our country and our planet. 
What I learned a long time ago is if youâ€™re a public figure and youâ€™re opinionated and outspoken, people will hate you for it â€” even if they agree with what youâ€™re saying. But itâ€™s really nice: Iâ€™ve been doing this for a long time and at this point I just donâ€™t care. Whatâ€™s someone gonna do â€” not buy my records? Itâ€™s 2016, no one buys records anyway.
