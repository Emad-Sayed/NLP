Q. If Trump wins can it be considered a repudiation of the national news mediocrity? A. I certainly hope so! 
The performance of the major news outlets this election cycle has been something to behold. Itâ€™s been the worst, most shallow undertaking I can remember. And I remember the treatment Goldwater got. 
I wrote here on Lewâ€™s blog last week about the hysterical reaction Gloria Borger and others had to Trumpâ€™s unwillingness to promise to respect the election results in advance. 
They acted like panicked teenage girls in a horror movie. 
Pat Buchanan explains the mediaâ€™s panic. â€œThe establishment is terrified that it has lost the country,â€ he says. â€œThe country no longer believes in its leadership.â€ 
About time! 
Now with the Comey development it wonâ€™t be long before Dems start talking about a rigged system. 
Another moment of equal media idiocracy: When the Clintonistas blamed Russia for spilling DNC emails that showed its secret collaboration with Hillary and against Bernie Sanders. 
Trump said â€œRussia, if youâ€™re listening, I hope youâ€™re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing!â€ 
The line wasnâ€™t well-delivered. But it was still funny. 
Even so, the joke was lost on the usual suspects. I watched CNNâ€™s Jake Tapperâ€™s visage grow dark as he expressed grave concern that Trump was inviting the Russians to interfere in our election. 
The whole thing brings to mind an old vaudeville comedy routine with, letâ€™s say, Joe and Moe: Joe: Iâ€™m offended by the mediaâ€™s alarmist reaction to Trumpâ€™s email joke. Moe: Are you offended as a Trump supporter? Joe: No, Iâ€™m offended as a person with a sense of humor! 11:09 am on October 29, 2016
