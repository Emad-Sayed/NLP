MoveOn.org is a George Soros NGOâ€¦and George Soros NGOs have nothing to do with charity or justice, and everything to do with political leverage, and in extreme cases government insurrection. 
We have seen Soros begin destructive movements to remove those he deems unsuitable to govern in a variety of countries, most recently in Ukraine, with the Soros sponsored Maidan coup. 
Now it looks like Soros may be setting his sights on sabotaging the forthcoming Trump presidency. 
We do know, thanks to Wikileaks, that George Soros was a huge supporter of Hillary Clinton, as Hillary Clinton was always looking out of George Sorosâ€™ best interests. 
We are certain Trumpâ€™s victory is a bitter pill for globalist Soros to swallow. Between Putin and Trump, Soros may finally be starting to feel his power on the world stage falter. 
We will see if MoveOn.orgâ€™s call to protest has legs, or if it will gradually fizzle and fade, in much the same way we can only hope Soros will eventually do.

â€œItâ€™s surreal in NYC. People are walking around like zombies with thousand yard stares.â€ 
Zerohedge reports â€¦ 
Seemingly unwilling to accept the results of the democratic selection of the nationâ€™s leader for the next four years, hundreds of grieving Hillary Clinton supporters â€“ egged on by George Sorosâ€™ MoveOn.org â€“ are laying siege to Trump Tower in New York City. Screaming â€œFuck Donald Trumpâ€, yelling â€œNot My Presidentâ€, chanting â€œPussy Grabs Backâ€, and burning the American flag, it appears these young millennials are just the kind of deplorables this country should be proud ofâ€¦ 
MoveOn.org released this press release on Wednesday, calling on people to take to the streets: 
Americans to Come Together in Hundreds Peaceful Gatherings of Solidarity, Resistance, and Resolve Following Election Results 
Hundreds of Americans, dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the White House and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia.

â€œThis is a disaster. We fought our hearts out to avert this reality. But now itâ€™s here,â€ MoveOn.org staff wrote to members on Wednesday. â€œThe new president-elect and many of his most prominent supporters have targeted, demeaned, and threatened millions of usâ€”and millions of our friends, family, and loved ones. Both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands. We are entering an era of profound and unprecedented challenge, a time of danger for our communities and our country. In this moment, we have to take care of ourselves, our families, and our friendsâ€”especially those of us who are on the front lines facing hate, including Latinos, women, immigrants, refugees, Black people, Muslims, LGBT Americans, and so many others. And we need to make it clear that we will continue to stand together.â€
