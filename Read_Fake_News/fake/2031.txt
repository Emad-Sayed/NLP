Newt Gingrich has accused Fox Newsâ€™ Megyn Kelly of being â€œfascinatedâ€ by sex, and not caring at all about public policy in a shocking and startling interview. 
The former Speaker of the House said Kelly showed â€œbiasâ€ for mentioning the groping allegations against Donald Trump. 
Kelly responded by saying her fascination is not of â€œsex,â€ but of who was going to end up in the White House. Kelly has a history with Trump â€“ getting into a shouting match with the Republican candidate over comments he made about women during a primary debate. 
What set Gingrich off was Kellyâ€™s mention of the leaked â€œsex boastsâ€ tapes, where Trump is heard to say he grabs women by the genitals. 
Gingrich attacked, saying the media was obsessed with spending time on the unsubstantiated allegations of sexual misconduct, which Trump has denied. â€œYou are fascinated with sex and you donâ€™t care about public policy,â€ he said. 
â€œIâ€™m not fascinated by sex, but Iâ€™m fascinated about sexual predators,â€ Kelly said. 
The bias the media has against Trump â€“ especially focusing on sex â€“ is historic. 
â€œThis is a scale of bias worthy of Pravda and Izvestia, â€ Gingrich said.
