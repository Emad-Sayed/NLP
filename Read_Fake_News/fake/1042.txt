A COUNTY Waterford man is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment today after he was unable to get over the amount of â€kidsâ€™ in a local night club last night. 
Michael Roache, 43, is said to be suffering from a rare form of temporary psychosis, which forces him to repeat himself continually for its duration. 
â€œIt started after he arrived home last night,â€ wife Deirdre Roache recalls, â€œI thought nothing of it until this morning, when I found him staring at the ceiling in bed, murmuring the same thing over and over again: â€I canâ€™t get over the amount of kids in here'â€. 
Worried, the mother of children immediately called her local care doctor, who in turn referred him to a psychiatric unit for further testing. 
It is understood the self-employed man was overwhelmed when he entered the popular nightclub in the city centre, triggering something in his head and sending him into a loop. 
â€œHe kept saying over and over again that he couldnâ€™t get over the amount of kids in the place,â€ friend Dermot Ryan told WWN, who is also way too old for night clubs, â€œWe just went in for a late drink because we were working late. Itâ€™ll be the last time I go into that fucking place. I felt so oldâ€. 
Mr. Roache is currently being treated for verbal looping at the psychiatric unit, and doctors have suggested temporarily moving him to an old folks home in a bid to â€snap him out of itâ€™. 
â€œThis kind of thing is common in the over 35â€™s,â€ Dr. Kevin Maher explained, â€œHopefully an hour or two in the old folks home will neutralize his psychosis. He should have known better going to a nightclub at his age, thoughâ€.
