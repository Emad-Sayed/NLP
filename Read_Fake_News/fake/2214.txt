(REUTERS) U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Democrat Hillary Clintonâ€™s plan for Syria would â€œlead to World War Three,â€ because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear-armed Russia.
 
In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, Trump said defeating Islamic State is a higher priority than persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, playing down a long-held goal of U.S. policy.

â€œWhat we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,â€ said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. â€œYouâ€™re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.
â€œYouâ€™re not fighting Syria any more, youâ€™re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,â€ he said.
