An unidentified supporter of Republican presidential candidate and alleged unregistered sex offender Donald Trump took to violently harassing members of the media at a Saturday night rally held in Phoenix, Arizona. 
The man, wearing a â€œHillary for Prisonâ€ t-shirt, screamed into the press area, â€œYouâ€™re going down! Youâ€™re the enemy! Youâ€™re the ones working for the devil!,â€ before adapting the crowdâ€™s â€œUSAâ€ chant into â€œJew-s-a,â€ all the while continuing to scream at the members of the media in the press pen. 
Candace Smith, of ABC, was one of the reporters to capture the manâ€™s disturbing behavior on tape. She posted video of the disturbing press area encounter to Twitter, a video which is featured below. This is the man who started chanting â€œJEW-S-Aâ€ at the media pen.

Smith included in the text accompanying her video post a question, saying in reference to seemingly intentional hand gestures on the part of the Trump supporter, â€œDoes anyone know what those hand signs mean?â€ 
Smith got at least a couple noteworthy and credible responses. 
Clayton Swisher, whose Twitter bio reads that he is an â€œinvestigative reporter and author,â€ suggested that the Trump supporterâ€™s hand gestures are a variation of the â€œ88â€ hand sign used by white supremacists and described by the Anti-Defamation League as follows: 
â€One of the most popular white supremacist symbols is the numeric symbol 88, which stands for â€œHeil Hitlerâ€ (substituting letters for numbers, 88 means HH, i.e., â€œHeil Hitlerâ€). It is thus not surprising that white supremacists occasionally attempt to display 88 as a hand sign.â€™

A Twitter user identified as Marisel Morales suggested that the hand gestures were the â€œScwhurhand,â€ which is a German salute used in court. @CandaceSmith_ It's a German salute known as Schwurhand

A Twitter user with the username â€œ@puppymnkeyâ€ countered, however, that the Trump supporterâ€™s hand gestures didnâ€™t quite match the Schwurhand, and instead pointed to a hand gesture version of the number â€œ666â€ employed by conspiracy theorists, a group almost certainly the man at the Trump rally. @57MCM @CandaceSmith_ nope. That salute is with pinky and index finger touching. It could be this given he's Infowars idiot pic.twitter.com/u953UYor2K

Nick Corasaniti of The New York Times was another member of the press to capture the manâ€™s disturbing behavior on film. 
His video, which runs a bit after Smithâ€™s video concludes, is featured below. 
In this second video, the man can be heard saying that â€œWeâ€™re run by the Jews, okay?â€ Guy chants â€œJew-S-Aâ€ in front of press pen pic.twitter.com/2yqgA6dD4k

At the same rally, Politicoâ€™s Ben Schrekinger captured an image of a man he said â€œhad been staring at the press for some timeâ€ and was â€œholding an object.â€ 
Security, Schrekinger says, was notified of the manâ€™s behavior. Bearded man's been staring at press for some time. Television reporter said he is holding object + notified security pic.twitter.com/phDvXFGgGw

Trump has long targeted the press in his incitement antics, as put on full display in his campaign rallies. He claims that the media has collaborated to â€œrigâ€ the election against him by supposedly dishonest coverage of his campaign on their part.
