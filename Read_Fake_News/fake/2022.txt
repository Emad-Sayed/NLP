Corporate Army smashes Dakota barbarians near lucrative pipeline By hatesec , on October 28th, 2016 Faceless marauders crushed a Native Rebellion on Friday that threatened to impede construction of a sweet new oil pipeline across the Northern US. 
Citing unfounded claims that oil pipelines leak into water supplies , opposition forces escalated their protest into a mounted assault that led to the injury of at least a few of their horses. 
The sheriffâ€™s department participated in the defense, having pledged allegiance to the neoliberal javelin of law, and vowed to smash savagery at its root, even if it means cleansing. 
â€œEthnic cleansing is not a word I like to use, because it evokes images of holocaust and genocide,â€ he said. â€œBut we must leave all options on the table.â€ 
Dakota Access Pipeline is projected to be profitable as FUCK and totally keep oil prices low as shit, yâ€™all, so chill. Get those bad thoughts out of your heads. Itâ€™s gonna be DANK once that fucker gets built. Iâ€™m talking $1.99 per gallon until something like 2020! 93 octane!
