Not sure what those â€œthingsâ€ are yet, but Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ll come. 
Thereâ€™s a lot of â€œsomethingâ€ going on today, at least within me. There was a period of time today when I felt I was walking around in another dimensionâ€¦ definitely not here , fully, at least, and more like in a â€œdreamâ€ or â€œtransparentâ€ type of shape. It actually felt very pleasant, and very much more â€œat homeâ€ than living upon/in this 3D-4D-whatever type physical â€œworldâ€ thing. 
I have â€œstuffâ€ to do, as I walk and move and BE upon this planetâ€¦ even though I know I AM a BE ing of Light, yet I am here in the physical body, and I (apparently) have accepted that and know I have â€œphysical typeâ€ areas in which to â€œworkâ€ (lots of quote marks in there). 
This blog will very likely always be a secondary part of my expression here, however, as my DOing and BEing primarily centers on the â€œEnergy workâ€ I feel is mine to do. It is particularly significant that I am in Hawaiâ€™i, formerly known as Lemuria, and performing most of the â€œEnergy missionsâ€ over here. Somehow the islands feel like fingers of my own handâ€¦ and that has been true ever since I first arrived. 
Iâ€™m not trying to â€œteachâ€ anything here. Just share the â€œsenseâ€ I have about all this stuffâ€¦ from my viewpointâ€¦ no one elseâ€™s. 
So why am I writing this particular post? Well, as always, I felt an urgent movement to do so. And I presume Iâ€™ll be following or listening to that â€œmovementâ€ for my entire experience here on this planet. 
That is all for now. 
Aloha, Kp
