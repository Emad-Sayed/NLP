RESIDENTS PLAN ARMED TRICK-OR-TREATING AFTER CREEPY CLOWN THREATS 0 SHARES [10/20/16] Some residents unnerved by scary clown threats in their communities say theyâ€™ll be armed for Halloween trick-or-treating, while authorities warn that widespread clown fears may endanger someone dressing up as a clown as a joke. 
There have been numerous clown sightings in Brevard County, and two men were arrested last week in Melbourne for allegedly threatening people while dressed as clowns and holding large bats, sticks or axes, according to a Florida Today reporter . 
The incidents have made some residents so nervous that they planned to arm themselves when they go out Halloween night. 
â€œSince I have no gun, I will be carrying a bat around on Halloween night,â€ said Pam Metz of Titusville. 
Kimberly Kersey said sheâ€™d carry a gun while taking her sons trick-or-treating in Palm Bay. 
â€œIâ€™ll be carrying for sure,â€ she said. â€œIâ€™m terrified of clowns already and if one messes with me or my kids itâ€™ll be to the hospital or morgue they go.â€ 
Police typically increase patrols for Halloween. Some law enforcement officials have urged people to reconsider dressing up as clowns to avoid inadvertently endangering themselves. 
â€œThe problem is that someone dressed like a clown could scare someone and thereâ€™s a possibility â€” a possibility â€” you could end up with someone getting shot,â€ said Palm Bay Police Lt. Mike Bandish. 
Cassandra Closson of West Melbourne gave the same advice to her 15-year-old son and forbade him from dressing as a clown. 
â€œJust not worth any drama,â€ Closson told Florida Today. Post navigation
