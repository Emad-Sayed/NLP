Ex-Assistant FBI Director: Clintons Are a Crime Family October   
That's quite an endorsement . And if there's anything top FBI officials now, it's crime families. Certainly this is probably the first serious level of experience that Hillary can claim in any field. 
â€œThe Clintons, thatâ€™s a crime family, basically,â€ former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom said. â€œItâ€™s like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.â€ 
â€œKallstrom, best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late '90s, said that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was a â€œpathological liar.â€ 
He also blasted Attorney General Loretta Lynch, claiming that she impeded the investigation into Clintonâ€™s private server. 
â€œThe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation,â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, Iâ€™m sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.â€ 
Kallstrom also said that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the FBIâ€™s leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation, not the rest of the bureau. 
â€œThe agents are furious with whatâ€™s going on, I know that for a fact,â€ he said. 
But according to the media, the FBI investigating Hillary is the real crime.
