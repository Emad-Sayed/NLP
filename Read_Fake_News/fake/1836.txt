America Has Become A Lawless Nation â€“ Hillary Clinton Magically Cleared By The FBI By Michael Snyder, on July 5th, 2016 
It is hard to be proud to be an American today after watching FBI director James Comey magically clear Hillary Clinton of all wrongdoing. Sadly, Comey is likely to go down in history as the man that struck the final death blow to the rule of law in America. During his address to the media, Comey admitted that Clinton sent or received 110 emails in 52 email chains that contained classified material at the time they were sent. But of course there were probably many more. Comey told the press that it was â€œ likely that there are other work-related emails that they did not produce â€¦ that are now gone because they deleted all emails they did not return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their devices .â€ So basically Clinton turned over to the FBI whatever she felt like turning over, and then she destroyed the rest of the evidence. As a former lawyer, this infuriates me, but it doesnâ€™t surprise me. 
In fact, it doesnâ€™t surprise me at all that Hillary Clinton was allowed to skate. I expected this all along. If you search the thousands of articles that I have posted on The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream , you will find many articles where I say that Hillary Clinton should be in prison, but not a single one where I ever said that I thought she would be going to prison. 
This is how politics in America works today. People like Bill and Hillary Clinton could openly sacrifice children to Satan on the White House lawn and still probably not get into trouble. Despite scandal after scandal going all the way back to Arkansas in the 1980s, nothing ever sticks to them, and nothing probably ever will. 
In this case, FBI director James Comey essentially had to rewrite federal law in order to clear Clinton. This is something that Andrew McCarthy explained very well in his article entitled â€œFBI Rewrites Federal Law to Let Hillary Off the Hookâ€ â€¦ 
There is no way of getting around this: According to Director James Comey (disclosure: a former colleague and longtime friend of mine), Hillary Clinton checked every box required for a felony violation of Section 793(f) of the federal penal code (Title 18): With lawful access to highly classified information she acted with gross negligence in removing and causing it to be removed it from its proper place of custody, and she transmitted it and caused it to be transmitted to others not authorized to have it, in patent violation of her trust. Director Comey even conceded that former Secretary Clinton was â€œextremely carelessâ€ and strongly suggested that her recklessness very likely led to communications (her own and those she corresponded with) being intercepted by foreign intelligence services. â€”â€“ 
In essence, in order to give Mrs. Clinton a pass, the FBI rewrote the statute, inserting an intent element that Congress did not require. The added intent element, moreover, makes no sense: The point of having a statute that criminalizes gross negligence is to underscore that government officials have a special obligation to safeguard national defense secrets; when they fail to carry out that obligation due to gross negligence, they are guilty of serious wrongdoing. The lack of intent to harm our country is irrelevant. People never intend the bad things that happen due to gross negligence. 
The amazing thing is that the FBI handled a highly similar case very, very differently less than a year ago. Just check out what happened to Naval reservist Bryan Nishimura â€¦ 
U.S. Magistrate Judge Kendall J. Newman immediately sentenced Nishimura to two years of probation, a $7,500 fine, and forfeiture of personal media containing classified materials. Nishimura was further ordered to surrender any currently held security clearance and to never again seek such a clearance. 
According to court documents, Nishimura was a Naval reservist deployed in Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008. In his role as a Regional Engineer for the U.S. military in Afghanistan, Nishimura had access to classified briefings and digital records that could only be retained and viewed on authorized government computers. Nishimura, however, caused the materials to be downloaded and stored on his personal, unclassified electronic devices and storage media. He carried such classified materials on his unauthorized media when he traveled off-base in Afghanistan and, ultimately, carried those materials back to the United States at the end of his deployment. In the United States, Nishimura continued to maintain the information on unclassified systems in unauthorized locations, and copied the materials onto at least one additional unauthorized and unclassified system . 
Nishimuraâ€™s actions came to light in early 2012, when he admitted to Naval personnel that he had handled classified materials inappropriately . Nishimura later admitted that, following his statement to Naval personnel, he destroyed a large quantity of classified materials he had maintained in his home . Despite that, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Nishimuraâ€™s home in May 2012, agents recovered numerous classified materials in digital and hard copy forms. The investigation did not reveal evidence that Nishimura intended to distribute classified information to unauthorized personnel. 
So what is the difference between Nishimura and Clinton? 
Neither of them ever intended to do anything wrong. 
So why were they treated so differently? 
Needless to say, social media is exploding with outrage over this decision to let Clinton go free. Many Americans are openly asking why they should continue to play by the rules if politicians like Hillary Clinton are not required to do so. 
Unfortunately, this is what America has become. Our politicians are a reflection of who we are as a society, and as I have stated before Hillary Clinton is going to be the overwhelming favorite if there is an election in November. At this moment, she has solid leads in all of the â€œswing statesâ€, and she only really needs to win one of them â€¦ 
Perhaps you enjoy talk of battleground states. Well, thereâ€™s a scenario for you, too. First, pick the six â€œclosestâ€ swing states (VA, NH, IA, OH, FL, NC). Got it? Now understand that New Hampshire excepted, Clinton only has to win one of them in order to reach the requisite 270 electoral votes to win . (Optional third step for Republicans only: start shotgunning Pabst Blue Ribbon and donâ€™t stop until November.) 
Lest any Trump supporters seek solace in poll numbers, recent polls have Trump sliding further behind in all the relevant swing states. According to a Ballotpedia battleground poll released last week, Trump trails by 14% in Florida, 4% in Iowa, 10% in North Carolina, 9% in Ohio, and 7% in Virginia. 
Hillary Clinton is a horrible, evil, miserable human being , and right now she is the odds-on favorite to become the next president of the United States. 
But ultimately it is the American people that are to blame for blindly supporting corrupt politicians such as Clinton, and if they willingly pick her to be our next president then we will certainly deserve whatever consequences follow.

I struggle trying to get my head around this. It goes against all reasonable consideration of law and civilized society. What refocuses and grounds me is when I consider that this is another puzzle piece of end time prophecy being put into place. This brings me closer to an understanding of Gods will for me and my place in it all. The best part is that I am already saved and cleared for the afterlife.

We turned on the TV just to watch the announcement that Comey had to make about Clinton. Just as he made the announcement that indicated that their recommendations to the DOJ would be to not press charges, that very second a loud boom went off in my house sounding exactly like a cannon and my husband and both sons saw a purple bolt of lightning outside and a ball of fire and then my TV froze with the words coming out Aof Comeyâ€™s mouth. Iâ€™ve never experienced anything like that in my life. We all felt that it had spiritual implications in regards to the announcement made. aldownunder

9/11 was Godâ€™s judgment against this nation. Please read the Isaiah 9:10 prophesy and then read what God will do to this nation as a result of our defiance from Isaiah 9:11-10:4. He will utterly destroy this nation. You say that God will never do such a thing. He will and know this that when you walk into church, any church and see if any pulpits says anything at all about this this coming Sunday. The answer will be no. God in the prophecy says the pulpit is wholly to blame. During the homosexual marriage issue how many pulpits came out against this abomination? None. Why? Because God has blinded just like pharaoh of Egypt the pulpit. They have been consumed with the outward versus the inward. They are vipers among vipers. Steeve Girard 
911 was the warning of the Arab Worldâ€¦ the Americans ignored it with â€œexceptionalismâ€. Time to cough-up. bahmi 
911 was meant to blame Muslims for everything connected, but the jews and neocons were behind 911, along with the Saudis. This was, however, a distraction so the real bad guys could install people like Obongo and let his destructive agenda destroy us, choke us in debt, focus on homosexuality, same sex butt banging, etc. While we were occupied with the distractions, the real bad guys did their thing and now have us on the precipice of total destruction and NWO marginalization. If you voted for Obama, YOU are part of the problem. GV

Amen. This Is why I am convinced Hitlery will be the next president. Itâ€™s all apart of the plan to destroy American Constitution and sovereignty during her â€œreignâ€ 
She is what the sheeple, illegals and liberal, progressives are calling for, and the Lord will oblige the desires of those who mock, blaspheme and spit in the face of the God of our heritage, â€œnatureâ€™s Godâ€ 
Nothing will change until the pulpits start preaching Truth and a nation repents JC Teecher 
All is going along with the prophetic word and the nations are aiding and abetting to the â€œfullness of the Gentilesâ€, (islamic peoples). JC Teecher 
The pulpits, for the most part, are bringing about the apostasy. sad 
No, the church wants to be liked and civil in this matter. Sin is a three letter bad word. Churches are more interested inâ€communityâ€ and not scaring people off with the truth. Unfortunately, that is the majority of churches today.They didnâ€™t scare me. The only truth that scared me was Hell and I was scared into the kingdom by Godâ€™s love for me a sinner. That He died for me to save me. Donâ€™t hear much about that these days. Politically incorrect. on the way to Hell. Jerry C 
Actually, Iâ€™d say sin is a five-letter word, death. lol watchmannonthewall 
I somewaht agree with you regarding Godâ€™s move against the US, but I tend more towards 9/11 being one of a couple of disciplines and warnings, the 2008 meltdown was the other, regarding coming judgment on the nation rather than it actually being a judgment. If Athaliah becomes president, she will be just like the real Athaliah; narcissistic and paranoid, and her rage will extend to â€œChristiansâ€. She is power hungary and has a self destruct button that will take all with her. At that point, I think it quite likely the warnings of the destruction of America by about 2020-21 will probably occur. Joe Trevors 
I believe we are experiencing the End Times battle between the Body of Christ & the Body of Antichrist. Our war is not against flesh & blood but against the spiritual powers on high. Yes, Kent, you do see how our nation is being transformed by the installation of leaders in our society who are following the Antichrist. But also our nation is filled with millions of people who are following the Christ. One way I see this is to view Islam as the Trojan Horse to bring down Christianity. Yes, it is bringing down the Church but it cannot hurt the Head of the Church, Jesus, so it is making war on the Body of Christ, the members one of another. You can today how Islam is being used by our government to destroy the Church in Syria? Muslims are killing Christians & other Muslims in Syria. NowAlive 
Perhaps Mr Cahn is right. Itâ€™s an interesting premise, to be sure. What I will say is that the idea that â€œnoneâ€, meaning no pulpits spoke out against homosexual marriage, is simply wrong. Many spoke of judgment because of it. But you are certainly right about vipers filling the most pulpits. They are indeed blind. Alas that the Baby Boomers now run this countryâ€¦off a cliff. GV

Only God knows who will be the next President. It is important for us to pray to the Lord & trust God as we say the Lordâ€™s prayer in part, â€œThy will be done on earth as it is in Heavenâ€. We need our faith more than ever during these days of tribulations. God can do anything he wants. God answers our prayers but we do not understand how he answers us, do we? Oz Steamer 
She looks likely to be the LAST President of the United States. Jerry C 
Why would TPTB collapse the economy on one of their own? My gut says they want a white conservative Christian male at the helm to blame it on, so Trump is the man of the hour.

I will not be voting because the next President, Hillary has already been â€œselected.â€ Hillary with a satanic grin on her disgusting face will be taking our guns, and sending us to FEMA camps. I have No doubt that these are the End Times! God bless eveyone. Steeve Girard

Omarâ€™s Dad was preaching what Omar followed. Omarâ€™s Dad works for the CIA. The FBI was forbidden to bother Omar no matter what he threatened. The FBI does not even know to investigate Omarâ€™s dad. What about the MOSQUE where Omar worshipped? The FBI is super good â€“ in covering up!! Randy 
GREAT post there, Joe! Except that Orlando was a completely contrived event, just like Sandy Hoax. WHERE were the ambulances to carry off the dead bodies? Where was all of the blood?

Our greatest hope is to vote for Donald Trump. I believe God is using Donald. It is a sign by the overwhelming opposition against him by both Democrats & Republicans. Look at Republican Paul Ryan as House Majority leader: he has no trouble â€œunderstandingâ€ Obama or Clinton. But he canâ€™t â€œunderstandâ€ Trump? Paul say I donâ€™t know where Donald is coming from. Trump is exposing how we are already ruled by a ONE PARTY OLIGARCHY, that chooses who will be President. This time Trump is confounding their agenda. Trump is revealing how they are all lying to us & of course they all really support Hillary or a 3rd party candidate. Arenâ€™t they the ones who say â€œAnyone but Trumpâ€? JC Teecher 
Look at the bright side, even though it is just a dying ember of one, this brings the chosen one to the final phase of taking her pedestal of satanic hierarchy in ussag, and will eliminate the need for martial law in order to stave off the trump charge. 
I still believe we will see bank failures and an economic collapse whereby she will pull the exact same stunts as Odrama did, to filter off funds, but; I think it will stabilize after the â€œhaircutâ€ to the upper middle class wealth.

You conservatives are a funny bunch. Your answer to everything is to cut taxes, have a smaller government, and the World will be a better place.
