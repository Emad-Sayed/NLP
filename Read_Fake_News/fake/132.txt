Wait, what? New emails tied to the FBI's Clinton inquiry were discovered during the investigation into Anthony Weiner's sexting https://t.co/FMHEkn03B0 
Dude: Federal law enforcement officials said Friday that the new emails uncovered in the closed investigation into Hillary Clinton â€™s use of a private email server were discovered after the F.B.I. seized electronic devices belonging to Huma Abedin, an aide to Mrs. Clinton, and her husband, Anthony Weiner. â€¦ In a letter to Congress, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said that emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, and that they â€œappear to be pertinent to the investigation.â€ Mr. Comey said the F.B.I. was taking steps to â€œdetermine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.â€ He said he did not know how long it would take to review the emails, or whether the new information was significant.
