Next Swipe left/right Have The Sun really darkened the image of Brexit legal challenge winner Gina Miller? 
@Crookedfootball over on Twitter says, â€œLook how the Sun has darkened Gina Millerâ€™s skin compared to the Timesâ€ 
The Sun: 
The Times: 
Obviously this could be just web bollocks but @Ajjolley has checked the paper versions next to each other: 
â€œPrinted in same plantâ€, he says, â€œLittle doubt the Sun darkened photo of Gina Millerâ€ 
However @CaeruleanSea says, â€œas much as I loathe the Sun, the Times have upped the exposure on their pic. Google pics from that speech.â€ 
And yep â€“ he has a point: look at the BBC coverage Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37861888 
In conclusion: the media has sent us all entirely mad that weâ€™re now checking how dark people are in Photoshop.
