 
After the release of a WikiLeaks email chain from March 2015 on Tuesday in which a top Clinton aide admitted President Barack Obama falsely claimed he did not know about Hillary Clintonâ€™s private server use while she was secretary of state, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest sprung into action to deny that the president had lied about the issue.
â€œWhat the president said was an entirely factual response,â€ Earnest said to a group of reporters in Los Angeles where Obama was attending Democratic fundraisers.
Earnest then attempted to explain away all criticism of the presidentâ€™s actions as mere conspiracies.

He continued, â€œBut theyâ€™ve failed to put forward a conspiracy that withstands any scrutiny, so I guess they are back to recycling thoroughly debunked conspiracies.â€
Obama himself denied any knowledge of the server, telling CBS reporter Bill Plante in March 2015, just after the server revelations that he learned of the Clintonâ€™s private email server â€œthe same time everybody else learned it through news reports.â€
 
Several days after the server revelations in March 2015, Earnest told the press that Obama knew about Clintonâ€™s email address and had sent messages to it but knew nothing about a private server.
He reiterated that position on Tuesday.
â€œThe president did trade emails with Secretary Clinton, not a large number of them,â€ Earnest said.
â€œOf course the president had possession of Secretary Clintonâ€™s email address, but he did not have any knowledge of where her server was located or what sort of arrangements had been made to store her email.â€

â€œ[L]ooks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news,â€ Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said in a March 7, 2015 email published Tuesday by WikiLeaks.
