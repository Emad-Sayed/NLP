In todayâ€™s, 25th, Wikileaks release of hacked Podesta emails, one of the notable highlights is a March 2, 2015 exchange between John Podesta and Clinton aide Cheryl Mills in which the Clinton Campaign Chair says â€œOn another matterâ€¦.and not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails.â€ 
The email, which may indicate intent , was sent just days before the NYT story revealing the existence of Hillaryâ€™s email server, and Hillaryâ€™s press conference addressing what was at the time, the stunning revelation that she had a personal email account, and server, in her home.
Millsâ€™ response: â€œThink you just got your new nick name.â€
It is unclear which Lanny is referred to: the infamous former DOJ staffer Lanny Breuer who quit in January 2013 after telling Frontline that some banks are too big to fail, or, more likely Lanny Davis , special counsel to President Bill Clinton, and spokesperson for the President and the White House on matters concerning campaign-finance investigations and other legal issues.
It is also unclear for now which emails Podesta is referring to in the thread, but Podesta adds: â€œbetter to do so sooner than later.â€ We can hope that a subsequent response, yet to be leaked by Wikileaks, will provide more color.
If the exchange is shown to disclose intent to mislead, it will negate the entire narrative prepared by Clinton that she merely deleted â€œpersonalâ€ emails and will reveal a strategic plan to hinder the State Department and FBI â€œinvestigation.â€
This is the first time that particular exchange has emerged among the Podesta emails.

And in a separate email sent out just days later by Clinton campaign communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, we get yet another confirmation that the president actively mislead the public when he said he didnâ€™t know Hillary was using a private email address:
Suggest Philippe talk to Josh or Eric. They know POTUS and HRC emailed . Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm. I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinetâ€™s email addresses.
Perhaps while the DOJ/FBI is taking a second look into Huma Abedinâ€™s emails, it can also take a repeat look at some of these, especially the ones involving POTUS. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple
