November 11, 2016 Nuclear weapons: how foreign hotspots could test Trumpâ€™s finger on the trigger 
On Donald Trumpâ€™s first day in office he will be handed the â€œnuclear biscuitâ€ â€“ a small card with the codes he would need to talk to the Pentagon war room to verify his identity in the event of a national security crisis. 
Some presidents have chosen to keep the â€œbiscuitâ€ on them, though that is not foolproof. Jimmy Carter left his in his clothes when he sent them to the dry-cleaners. Bill Clinton had it in his wallet with his credit cards, but then lost the wallet. 
Others have chosen to give the card to an aide to keep in a briefcase, known as the â€œnuclear footballâ€, together with a manual containing US war plans for different contingencies and one on â€œcontinuity of governmentâ€, where to go to ensure executive authority survives a first nuclear strike. 
The â€œbiscuitâ€ and â€œfootballâ€ are the embodiment of the awesome, civilisation-ending power that will be put in Trumpâ€™s hands on 20 January. They only become relevant in very rare moments of extreme crisis, but a US presidentâ€™s ability to manage crises around the world will help determine whether they become extreme.
