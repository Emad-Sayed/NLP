shorty Dispatches from Eric Zuesse 
O n November 1st, The Intercept headlined â€œHEREâ€™S THE PROBLEM WITH THE STORY CONNECTING RUSSIA TO DONALD TRUMPâ€™S EMAIL SERVERâ€ , and the reporting team of Sam Biddle, Lee Fang, Micah Lee, and Morgan Marquis-Boire, revealed that: â€œSlateâ€™s Franklin Foer published a story thatâ€™s been circulating through the dark web and various newsrooms since summertime, an enormous, eyebrow-raising claim that Donald Trump uses a secret server to communicate with Russia. That claim resulted in an explosive night of Twitter confusion and misinformation. The gist of the Slate article is dramatic â€” incredible, even: Cybersecurity researchers found that the Trump Organization used a secret box configured to communicate exclusively with Alfa Bank, Russiaâ€™s largest commercial bank. This is a story that any reporter in our election cycle would drool over, and drool Foer did.â€ 
The Intercept team concluded their detailed analysis of the evidence by saying: Franklin Foer is an American warmonger and p.r. agent, a Democrat, and former editor of The [scurrilous Neocon] New Republic. Foer was a 2012 Bernard L. Schwartz fellow at the New America Foundation. â€œCould it be that Donald Trump used one of his shoddy empireâ€™s spam marketing machines, one with his last name built right into the domain name, to secretly collaborate with a Moscow bank? Sure. At this moment, thereâ€™s literally no way to disprove that. But thereâ€™s also literally no way to prove it, and such a grand claim carries a high burden of proof. Without more evidence it would be safer (and saner) to assume that this is exactly what it looks like: A company that Trump has used since 2007 to outsource his hotel spam is doing exactly that. Otherwise, weâ€™re all making the exact same speculation about the unknown thatâ€™s caused untold millions of voters to believe Hillaryâ€™s deleted emails might have contained Benghazi cover-up PDFs. Given equal evidence for both, go with the less wacky story.â€ 
However, they failed to dig deeper to explain what could have motivated this smear of Trump: was it just sloppiness on the part of Slate, and of Foer? Hardly â€” it was anything but unintentional: A core part of the Democratic Partyâ€™s campaign for Hillary Clinton consists of her claim that Donald Trump is secretly a Russian agent. This is an updated version of the Republican Joseph R. McCarthyâ€™s campaign to â€œroot communists out of the federal government,â€ and of the John Birch Societyâ€™s accusation even against the Republican President Dwight Eisenhower that, â€œWith regard to â€¦ Eisenhower, it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason.â€ 
Neoconservatives â€” in both Parties â€” are the heirs of the Republican Partyâ€™s hard-right, which now, even decades after the 1991 end of communism and the Soviet Union, hate Russia above all of their other passions. Neoconservatism has emerged as todayâ€™s Republican Partyâ€™s Establishment, and (like with the Democratic Partyâ€™s original neocon, U.S. Senator Henry â€œScoopâ€ Jackson, the â€œSenator from Boeingâ€) theyâ€™ve always viewed Russia to be Americaâ€™s chief enemy, and they have favored the overthrow of any nationâ€™s leader who is friendly toward Russia, such as Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, Viktor Yanukovych, and Bashar al-Assad. Hatred and demonization of Russia is the common core of neoconservatism â€” the post-Cold-War extension of Joseph R. McCarthy and the John Birch Society. Neoconservatives â€” in both Parties â€” are the heirs of the Republican Partyâ€™s hard-right, which now, even decades after the 1991 end of communism and the Soviet Union, hate Russia above all of their other passions. 
Both Slate and especially Foer have long pedigrees as Democratic Party neoconservatives â€” champions of U.S. invasions, otherwise called PR agents (â€journalistsâ€™) promoting the products and services that a few giant and exclusive military corporations such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Dyncorp, and the Carlyle Group, offer to the U.S. federal government. Iâ€™ll deal here only with Foer, not with his latest employer (in a string, all of which are neocon Democratic â€newsâ€™ media). Foer wrote in The New York Times , on 10 October 2004, against â€isolationistâ€™ Republicans, who regretted having supported George W. Bushâ€™s invasion of Iraq, and he headlined about them there, â€œOnce Again, America Firstâ€ , equating non -neoconservative Republicans with, essentially, the pro-fascist isolationists of the 1930s. He concluded that they would come to regret their regret: â€œConservatives could soon find themselves retracing Buckleyâ€™s steps, wrestling all over again with their isolationist instincts.â€ Thatâ€™s how far-right Franklin Foer is: heâ€™s to the right of those Republicans. .. On 7 June 2004, Foer, in a tediously long, badly written and argued, article in New York Magazine , â€œThe Source of the Troubleâ€ , described the downfall of The New York Timesâ€™s leading stenographer for George W. Bushâ€™s lies to invade Iraq, their reporter Judith Miller. He closed by concluding that â€œthe source of the troubleâ€ was that Miller was simply too earnest and tried too hard â€” not that she was a stenographer to power: .. â€œPeople like Miller, with her outsize journalistic temperament of ambition, obsession, and competitive fervor, relying on people like Ahmad Chalabi, with his smooth, affable exterior retailing false information for his own motives, for the benefit of people reading a newspaper, trying to get at the truth of whatâ€™s what. â€ .. (She was anything but â€œtrying to get at the truth of whatâ€™s what.â€ She was the opposite: a mere stenographer to George W. Bush and to the Administrationâ€™s chosen mouthpieces, such as the anti-Saddam exiled Iraqi Ahmad Chalaby.) O n 20 December 2004, when the question of whether to bomb Iran was being debated by neoconservatives, Foer, who then was the Editor of the leading Democratic Party neoconservative magazine, The New Republic , headlined in his magazine, â€œIdentity Crisis: Neocon v. Neocon on Iranâ€ , and he introduced a supposed non-neocon from the supposedly non-neocon Brookings Institution, Kenneth Pollack, to comment upon the conflict among ( the other Partyâ€™s ) neocons: â€œIn part, the lack of neocon consensus [on whether to, as John McCain was to so poetically put it, â€Bomb, bomb, bomb Iranâ€™ ] can be attributed to the nature of the problem. Nobody â€” not the Council on Foreign Relations, not John Kerryâ€™s brain trust â€” has designed a plausible policy to walk Iran back from the nuclear brink. Or, as Kenneth M. Pollack concludes in his new book, The Persian Puzzle, this is a â€problem from Hellâ€™ with no good solution.â€ But, actually, both Pollack and Brookings are Democratic Party neocons themselves; and among the leading proponents of invading Iraq had been not only Pollack but Brookingsâ€™s Michael Oâ€™Hanlon . Brookings had no prominent opponent of invading Iraq. (Brookings has a long history of neoconservatism , and routinely leads the Democratic Partyâ€™s contingent of neocon thinking, even urging a Democratic administration to have its stooge-regimes violate international laws .) The real reason why neocons (being the heirs of the far-right extremistsâ€™ Cold-War demonization of Russia, even after communism is gone) wanted to conquer both Iraq and Iran, was that both countriesâ€™ leaders were friendly towards Russia, and were opposed by the Saud family who own Saudi Arabia, which family quietly worked not only with the U.S. government but with Israelâ€™s government, against both Iraq and Iran, as well as against Syria â€” those three nations (Iraq, Iran, and Syria) all being friendly toward Russia, which both the Saudi aristocracy, and not only the U.S. aristocracy, hate. Itâ€™s not just the conservative â€newsâ€™ media that are neoconservative now. The so-called â€liberalâ€™ media are so neoconservative that, for example, Salon can condemn Donald Trump for his having condemned Hillary and Obamaâ€™s bombing of Libya. Salon condemned Trumpâ€™s having said â€œWe would be so much better off if Qaddafi were in charge right nowâ€ â€” as if Trump werenâ€™t correct, and as if what happened after our overthrow and killing of Qaddafi werenâ€™t far worse for both Libyans and the world than what now exists in Libya. (But, of course, for Lockheed Martin etc., it is far better). CBS News and Mother Jones condemned the Trilateralist Joseph Nye for having veered temporarily away from his normal neoconservatism. Then, Nye wrote in the neocon Huffington Post saying that David Corn of Mother Jones and Franklin Foer of The New Republic had misrepresented what he had said, and that he was actually a good neocon after all. Nye closed: â€œIn any case, I have never supported Gaddafi and am on record wishing him gone, and also on record supporting Obamaâ€™s actions in recent weeks. We now know that Gaddafiâ€™s departure is the only change that will work in Libya.â€ Sure, it did. Oh, really? Itâ€™s Trump who is crazy here? More recently, Foer headlined at Slate, â€œPutinâ€™s Puppet: If the Russian president could design a candidate to undermine American interests â€” and advance his own â€” heâ€™d look a lot like Donald Trump.â€ Foer proceeded to present the view of Trump that subsequently became parroted by the Hillary Clinton campaign (that Trump=traitor). Wikipedia has a 450-person â€List of Republicans opposing Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016â€³ , and itâ€™s almost entirely comprised of well-known neoconservatives â€” the farthest-right of all Republicans, the people closest to Joseph R. McCarthy and the John Birch Society. Foer cited many neoconservative sources that are not commonly thought of as Republican, such as Buzzfeed; and he even had the gall to blame the Russian government for having made public its best evidence behind its charge (which was true ) that the overthrow of Ukraineâ€™s democratically elected President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014 was no authentic â€democratic revolutionâ€™ such as the U.S. government and its â€newsâ€™ media said, but was instead a very bloody U.S. coup dâ€™etat in Ukraine , which was organized from the U.S. Embassy there, starting by no later than 1 March 2013 , a year beforehand. Foer wrote: â€œThe Russians have made an art of publicizing the material they have filched to injure their adversaries. The locus classicus of this method was a recording of a blunt call between State Department official Toria [thatâ€™s actually â€Victoriaâ€™] Nuland [a close friend of both Hillary Clinton and Dick Cheney] and the American ambassador to Kiev, Geoffrey Pyatt. The Russians allegedly planted the recording on YouTube and then tweeted a link to it â€” and from there it became international news. Though they never claimed credit for the leak, few doubted the White Houseâ€™s contention that Russia was the source.â€ To a neoconservative, even defensive measures (such as Russiaâ€™s there exposing the lies that America uses to â€justifyâ€™ economic sanctions and other hostile acts against Russia) â€” indeed, anything that Russia does against Americaâ€™s aggressions against Russia, and against Russiaâ€™s allies (such as Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, Bashar al-Assad, and Viktor Yanukovych) â€” anything that Russia does, is somehow evil and blameworthy. And, of course, Americaâ€™s aggressions are not. The U.S. government and its neocon propagandists are outraged that some people are trying to expose â€” instead of to spread â€” their lies. The American government isnâ€™t yet neocon enough, in the view of such liars. About the author =SUBSCRIBE TODAY!
