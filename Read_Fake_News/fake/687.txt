References The Debate 
It started when Daniel Blatman, an Israeli historian and head of the Institute for Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, penned an op-ed for the Israeli daily Haaretz stating that ethnic cleansing â€œis exactly what happened in 1948.â€ To support this, Blatman cited Benny Morris: the Israeli historian, Blatman wrote, â€œdetermined that most of the Arabs in the country, over 400,000, were encouraged to leave or expelled in the first stage of the warâ€”even before the Arab nationsâ€™ armies invaded.â€ [2] Benny Morris, October 30, 2007 ( Aude / CC BY-SA 2.0 ) 
That prompted a response from Morris, who wrote an op-ed of his own titled â€œIsrael Conducted No Ethnic Cleansing in 1948â€. In it, he contends that Blatman â€œdistorts history when he says the new State of Israel, a country facing invading armies, carried out a policy of expelling the local Arabs.â€ And Blatman â€œbetrayed his professionâ€, Morris further charged, â€œwhen he attributed to me things I have never claimed and distorted the events of the 1948 war.â€ 
Central to Morrisâ€™s argument is that â€œBlatman ignores the basic fact that the Palestinians were the ones who started the war when they rejected the UN compromise plan and embarked on hostile acts in which 1,800 Jews were killed between November 1947 and mid-May 1948.â€ Moreover, the neighboring Arab states had â€œthreatened to invade even before the UN resolution was passed on November 29, 1947, and before a single Arab had been uprooted from his home.â€ Even prior to the adoption of General Assembly Resolution 181, which recommended partitioning Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish states, they Arab states had continuously declared their intent â€œto attack the Jewish state when the British left.â€ 
He acknowledges that prior to the Zionistsâ€™ declaration of the existence of Israel on May 14, 1948, and the subsequent introduction of Arab statesâ€™ regular armies into the conflict, a few hundred thousand Arabs (though a number â€œapparently smallerâ€ than the figure of 400,000 cited by Blatman) â€œwere expelled from their homes and forced to fleeâ€. 
How can it be true that, on one hand, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced from their homes and never allowed to return, yet also true, on the other, that there was no ethnic cleansing? 
Morris attempts to reconcile the apparent contradiction by arguing that â€œat no stage of the 1948 war was there a decision by the leadership of the Yishuv [the Jewish community] or the state to â€expel the Arabsâ€™â€. In other words, itâ€™s true that many Arabs were indeed expelled, but this was not the result of an official policy of the Zionist leadership. 
â€œItâ€™s true that in the 1930s and early â€40sâ€, Morris further acknowledges, â€œDavid Ben-Gurion and Chaim Weizmann supported the transfer of Arabs from the area of the future Jewish state. But later they supported the UN decision, whose plan left more than 400,000 Arabs in place. 
â€œItâ€™s also true that from a certain point during the war, Ben-Gurion let his officers understand that it was preferable for as few Arabs as possible to remain in the new country, but he never gave them an order â€to expel the Arabs.â€™â€ 
And, true, there was an â€œatmosphere of transfer that prevailed in the country beginning in April 1948â€, but this â€œwas never translated into official policyâ€”which is why there were officers who expelled Arabs and others who didnâ€™t. Neither group was reprimanded or punished. 
â€œIn the end, in 1948 about 160,000 Arabs remained in Israeli territoryâ€”a fifth of the population.â€ 
Furthermore, â€œon March 24, 1948, Israel Galili, Ben-Gurionâ€™s deputy in the future Defense Ministry and the head of the Haganah, ordered all the Haganah brigades not to uproot Arabs from the territory of the designated Jewish state. Things did change in early April due to the Yishuvâ€™s shaky condition and the impending Arab invasion. But there was no overall expulsion policyâ€”here they expelled people, there they didnâ€™t, and for the most part the Arabs simply fled.â€ 
Morris acknowledges that the Zionist leadership in mid-1948 â€œadopted a policy of preventing the return of refugeesâ€, but asserts this was â€œlogical and justâ€ on the grounds that these were the â€œsame refugees who months and weeks earlier had tried to destroy the state in the making.â€ 
What happened in 1948 does not fit the definition of â€œethnic cleansingâ€, Morris concludes. The Arab states, on the other hand, â€œcarried out ethnic cleansing and uprooted all the Jews, down to the last one, from any territory they captured in 1948â€, while the Jews â€œleft Arabs in place in Haifa and Jaffaâ€, among other places. [3] Arabs leaving Haifa as Jewish forces enter the city ( Public Domain ) 
That wasnâ€™t the end of the discussion. Blatman responded in turn with an op-ed titled â€œYes, Benny Morris, Israel Did Perpetrate Ethnic Cleansing in 1948â€. In it, he writes that, â€œOn March 10, 1948, the national Haganah headquarters approved Plan Dalet, which discussed the intention of expelling as many Arabs as possible from the territory of the future Jewish state.â€ 
With regard to Morrisâ€™s denial that what occurred fits the definition of â€œethnic cleansingâ€, Blatman quotes the prosecutor in the trial of Radovan Karadzic, a Bosnian-Serb leader convicted for the ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Bosnia: 
In ethnic cleansing . . . you act in such a way that in a given territory, the members of a given ethnic group are eliminated. . . . You have massacres. Everybody is not massacred, but you have massacres in order to scare those populations. . . . Naturally, the other people are driven away. They are afraid . . . and, of course, in the end these people simply want to leave. . . . They are driven away either on their own initiative or they are deported. . . . Some women are raped and, furthermore, often times what you have is the destruction of the monuments which marked the presence of a given population . . . for instance, Catholic churches or mosques are destroyed. 
In other words, contrary to Morrisâ€™s argument, it doesnâ€™t follow that, since there is no document in which the Zionist leadership explicitly outlined a plan to expel all Arabs or in which military commanders were instructed to do so, therefore what occurred was not ethnic cleansing. What the prosecutor describes is exactly what happened in 1948, Blatman notes: â€œImplied instructions, silent understandings, sowing fear among the population whose flight is the objective; the destruction of the physical presence left behind.â€ 
Blatman quotes from Morrisâ€™s book The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947â€“1949 : 
The attacks of the Haganah and the Israel Defense Forces, expulsion orders, the fear of attacks and acts of cruelty on the part of the Jews, the absence of assistance from the Arab world and the Arab Higher Committee, the sense of helplessness and abandonment, orders by Arab institutions and commanders to leave and evacuate, in most cases was the direct and decisive reason for the flightâ€”an attack by the Haganah, Irgun, Lehi or the IDF, or the inhabitantsâ€™ fear of such an attack. 
Blatman adds, â€œThe expulsions were not war crimes, says Morris, because it was the Arabs who started the war. In other words, hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians who belong to the side that began the fighting have to be expelled. Maybe Morris would agree that the genocide carried out by the Germans against the Herero in 1904â€“1908 was justified since, after all, the Herero began the rebellion against German colonialism in Namibia.â€ [4] 
Next to weigh in on the debate was Steven Klein, a Haaretz editor and adjunct professor at Tel Aviv Universityâ€™s International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation. Klein notes how Morris himself, in a 1988 essay titled â€œThe New Historiographyâ€, had explained how under Plan D, the Zionist forces â€œcleared various areas completely of Arab villagesâ€, and how â€œJewish atrocities . . . and the drive to avenge past misdeeds also contributed significantly to the exodus.â€ A Palestinian woman and child (Source: Hanini.org / CC BY 3.0 ) 
And in his book Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881â€“2001 , â€œMorris observed that Ben-Gurionâ€™s views on â€transfer as a legitimate solution to the Arab problemâ€™ did not change after he publicly declared support for forced expulsions in the 1930s, but that â€he was aware of the need, for tactical reasons, to be discreet.â€™ Thus, so it seemed, he explained how Ben-Gurion could be responsible for the expulsion of many of the 700,000 Palestinian Arabs without ever issuing an order to that effect.â€ 
Then in a 2004 Haaretz interview with journalist Ari Shavit, Morris had said, â€œA Jewish state would not have come into being without the uprooting of 700,000 Palestinians. Therefore it was necessary to uproot them.â€ 
â€œMorris, of course, is welcome to change his political viewâ€, Klein continues. â€œBut he, like any other historian, must understand that he has left a paper trail that tells a substantially different narrative than the one he now advocates. The Benny Morris of 2016 seems to be doing what he once accused the â€old historiansâ€™ of doingâ€”interpreting history and downplaying Israeli misdeeds in order to defend Israelâ€™s legitimacy.â€ [5] 
Next to chime in on the debate was Ehud Ein-Gil, who points out in his own Haaretz op-ed that among the Arabs who were allowed to remain were â€œ15,000 Druze who had allied with Israel, 34,000 Christians, whom Israel treated decently so as not to anger its Western allies, and some Bedouin Muslim villages, whose leaders had allied with Israel or with their Jewish neighbors. 
â€œOf the 75,000 Muslims who remained (less than 15 percent of the prewar number), tens of thousands were internally displacedâ€”people who had fled their villages or were expelled from them and have not been allowed to return to their homes to this day.â€ 
â€œMorris is rightâ€, Ein-Gil continues, â€œwhen he mentions the â€atmosphere of transferâ€™ that gripped Israel from April 1948, but he errs when he claims that this atmosphere was never translated into official policy.â€ He quotes the orders given to commanders in Plan D to either destroy villages or encircle and then mount â€œsearch-and-control operationsâ€ within them and, in the event of resistance, to expel all inhabitants. [6] 
Finally, Morris responded once more to his critics with a Haaretz article titled â€œâ€Ethnic Cleansingâ€™ and pro-Arab Propagandaâ€, in which he characterizes their articles as not reflecting â€œa serious way of writing history.â€ 
His own â€œopinions about the history of 1948 havenâ€™t changed at allâ€, Morris asserts. He maintains that â€œSome Palestinians were expelled (from Lod and Ramle, for example), some were ordered or encouraged by their leaders to flee (from Haifa, for example) and most fled for fear of the hostilities and apparently in the belief that they would return to their homes after the expected Arab victory. 
â€œAnd indeed, beginning in June, the new Israeli government adopted a policy of preventing the return of refugeesâ€”those same Palestinians who fought the Yishuv, the prestate Jewish community, and tried to destroy it.â€ 
Morris contends, â€œIn 1947â€“1948 there was no a priori intention to expel the Arabs, and during the war there was no policy of expulsion. There are clearly Israel-hating â€historiansâ€™ like Ilan Pappe and Walid Khalidi, and perhaps also Daniel Blatman, going by what he has said, who see the Haganahâ€™s Plan Dalet of March 10, 1948, as a master plan for expelling the Palestinians. It isnâ€™t.â€ 
Rather, Plan D â€œwas intended to craft strategy and tactics for the Haganah to maintain its hold on strategic roads in what was to become the Jewish state. It also sought to secure the borders in the run-up to the expected Arab invasion following the departure of the British. Blatmanâ€™s contention that Plan Dalet â€discussed the intention of expelling as many Arabs as possible from the territory of the future Jewish stateâ€™ is a malicious falsification. These are the words of a pro-Arab propagandist, not of a historian.â€ 
Furthermore, Plan D â€œexplicitly states that the inhabitants of villages that fight the Jews should be expelled and the villages destroyed, while neutral or friendly villages should be left untouched (and have forces garrisoned there). 
â€œAs for Arab neighborhoods in mixed cities, the Haganah field commanders ordered that the Arabs of the outlying neighborhoods be transferred to the Arab centers of those cities, like Haifa, not expelled from the country.â€ 
Morris contends that, â€œif there had been a master plan and a policy of â€expelling the Arabs,â€™ we would have found indications of this in the various operational orders to the combat units, and in the reports to the command headquarters, like â€We carried out the expulsion in accordance with the master planâ€™ or â€with Plan Dalet.â€™ There are no such mentions.â€ 
True, â€œthere was an â€atmosphere of transfer,â€™â€ but this was â€œunderstandable in light of the circumstances: constant attacks by Palestinian militias over four months and the expectation of an impending invasion by the Arab armies aimed at annihilating the Jewish state to be and perhaps the people as well.â€ 
This â€œnecessitated occupation and the expelling of villagers who ambushed, sniped at and killed Jews along the borders and the main roads.â€ Moreover, â€œthe vast majority of Arabs fled, and the officers of the Haganah/IDF had no need to face the decision of whether to expel them.â€ [7] On the night of April 7-8, under the command of Abd al-Qadir al-Husseini, Palestinian irregulars counterattacked the Haganah occupiers of Castel. The Palestinians are seen here moving to the counterattack. From Walid Khalidi, Before Their Diaspora, page 334. ( Public Domain ) Points of Agreement 
While there are a number of points on which Morris and his critics heatedly disagree, itâ€™s imperative to begin by highlighting those facts that arenâ€™t in dispute. 
First and foremost, itâ€™s completely uncontroversial that hundreds of thousands of Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes by the Zionist forces during the 1948 warâ€”about 700,000, according to Morris, by the time it was done. 
Also uncontroversial is the fact that much of this flight and expulsion occurred well before the neighboring Arab states sent in their armies following the Zionistsâ€™ declaration of the existence of the state of Israel on May 14, 1948. 
In his book The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947â€“1949 , Morris estimates the number of Arabs made refugees prior to May 14 at somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000. In his book The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine , Israeli historian Ilan Papp© writes, â€œThere were in fact 350,000 if one adds all of the population from the 200 towns and villages that were destroyed by 15 May 1948.â€ [8] This is consistent with Morrisâ€™s remark that the number was â€œapparently smallerâ€ than 400,000. 
Another uncontroversial fact is that there was a prevailing â€œatmosphere of transferâ€ among the Zionist leadershipâ€”with â€œtransferâ€ being a euphemism for the forced displacement of Arabs from their homes. As Morris notes in his book 1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War , â€œan atmosphere of what would later be called ethnic cleansing prevailedâ€, and, to be sure, â€œmuch of the country had been â€cleansedâ€™ of Arabsâ€ by the end of the war. [9] David Ben-Gurion issues the Zionistsâ€™ unilateral declaration of the existence of the state of Israel on May 14, 1948, beneath a portrait of Theodor Herzl ( Rudi Weissenstein ) 
Indeed, the idea that the Arabs would have to go was an assumption inherent in the ideology of political Zionism. The Austro-Hungarian journalist Theodor Herzl, who is considered the father of the movement, outlined the Zionist project in a pamphlet titled The Jewish State in 1896. [10] A year prior, he had expressed in his diary the need to rid the land of its Arab majority: â€œWe shall have to spirit the penniless population across the border, by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while denying it any employment in our own country. Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly.â€ [11] 
In 1937, the British Peel Commission proposed that Palestine be partitioned into separate Jewish and Arab states, but there was a problem: there would remain an estimated 225,000 Arabs in the area proposed for the Jewish state. â€œSooner or later there should be a transfer of land and, as far as possible, an exchange of populationâ€, the Commission concluded. It proceeded to draw attention to the â€œinstructive precedentâ€ of an agreement between the governments of Greece and Turkey in the aftermath of the Greco-Turkish War of 1922 that determined that â€œGreek nationals of the Orthodox religion living in Turkey should be compulsorily removed to Greece, and Turkish nationals of the Moslem religion living in Greece to Turkey.â€ 
The Commission expressed its hope â€œthat the Arab and the Jewish leaders might show the same high statesmanship as that of the Turks and the Greeks and make the same bold decision for the sake of peace.â€ [12] 
Of course, the Commission was not unmindful of â€œthe deeply-rooted aversion which all Arab peasants have shown in the past to leaving the lands which they have cultivated for many generations. They would, it is believed, strongly object to a compulsory transfer . . . .â€ [13] OBSTACLE TO PEACE The US Role in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict by Jeremy R. Hammond Order Now Learn More 
As Morris notes in 1948 , â€œThe fact that the Peel Commission in 1937 supported the transfer of Arabs out of the Jewish state-to-be without doubt consolidated the wide acceptance of the idea among the Zionist leaders.â€ [14] â€œOnce the Peel Commission had given the idea its imprimatur, . . . the floodgates were opened. Ben-Gurion, Weizmann, Shertok, and othersâ€”a virtual consensusâ€”went on record in support of transfer at meetings of the JAE [Jewish Agency Executive] at the Twentieth Zionist Congress (in August 1937, in Zurich) and in other forums.â€ [15] Chaim Weizmann, for example, in January 1941 told the Soviet ambassador to London, Ivan Maiskii, â€œIf half a million Arabs could be transferred, two million Jews could be put in their place.â€ [16] 
The Zionist leader who would become Israelâ€™s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, after the Peel Commission had recommended the â€œcompulsory transferâ€ of Arabs, expressed his acceptance of the partition plan as a pragmatic first step toward the ultimate goal of establishing a Jewish state over all of the territory of Palestine. On October 5, 1937, he wrote to his son (underlined emphasis in original): 
Of course the partition of the country gives me no pleasure. But the country that they are partitioning is not in our actual possession; it is in the possession of the Arabs and the English. What is in our actual possession is a small portion, less than what they are proposing for a Jewish state. If I were an Arab I would have been very indignant. But in this proposed partition we will get more than what we already have, though of course much less than we merit and desire. . . . What we really want is not that the land remain whole and unified. What we want is that the whole and unified land be Jewish . A unified Eretz Israeli [ sic ] would be no source of satisfaction for meâ€”if it were Arab. 
Acceptance of â€œa Jewish state on only part of the landâ€, Ben-Gurion continued, was â€œnot the end but the beginning.â€ In time, the Jews would settle the rest of the land, â€œthrough agreement and understanding with our Arab neighbors, or through some other means â€ (emphasis added). If the Arabs didnâ€™t acquiesce to the establishment of a Jewish state in the place of Palestine, then the Jews would â€œhave to talk to them in a different languageâ€ and might be â€œcompelled to use forceâ€ to realize their goals. [17] 
â€œMy approach to the solution of the question of the Arabs in the Jewish stateâ€, said Ben-Gurion in June 1938, â€œis their transfer to Arab countries.â€ The same year, he told the Jewish Agency Executive, â€œI am for compulsory transfer. I do not see anything immoral in it.â€ [18] 
The idea of partitioning Palestine was resurrected by the UN Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), which had drawn up the plan endorsed by the UN General Assembly in Resolution 181 on November 29, 1947. This plan, too, contained the inherent problem of a sizable population of Arabs who would remain within the boundaries of the proposed Jewish state. Benny Morris documents the attitude of the Zionist leadership with respect to this dilemma: 
The Zionists feared that the Arab minority would prefer, rather than move to the Arab state, to accept the citizenship of the Jewish state. And â€œwe are interested in less Arabs who will be citizens of the Jewish state,â€ said Golda Myerson (Meir), acting head of the Jewish Agency Political Department. Yitzhak Gruenbaum, a member of the Jewish Agency Executive and head of its Labor Department, thought that Arabs who remained in the Jewish state but were citizens of the Arab state would constitute â€œa permanent irredenta.â€ Ben-Gurion thought that the Arabs remaining in the Jewish state, whether citizens of the Arab or Jewish state, would constitute an irredentaâ€”and in the event of war, they would become a â€œFifth Column.â€ If they are citizens of the Arab state, argued Ben-Gurion, â€œ[we] would be able to expel them,â€ but if they were citizens of the Jewish state, â€œwe will be able only to jail them. And it is better to expel them than jail them.â€ So it was better not to facilitate their receipt of Jewish state citizenship. But Ben-Gurion feared that they would prefer this citizenship. Eliâ€ezer Kaplan, the Jewish Agencyâ€™s treasurer, added: â€œOur young state will not be able to stand such a large number of strangers in its midst.â€ [19] 
In sum, there was a consensus that such a sizable population of Arabs within the borders of their desired â€œJewish stateâ€ was unacceptable. The events that followed must be analyzed within the context of this explicit understanding among the Zionist leadership that, one way or another, a large number of Arabs would have to go. Ruins of the former Arab village of Bayt Jibrin, in the West Bank west of Hebron. ( Public Domain ) Who Started the War? 
One of Morrisâ€™s main arguments underscoring his denial of ethnic cleansing is that it was the Arabs, not the Jews, who started the war after having rejected the UN partition plan. He points to hostile actions by the Arabs between the end of November 1947 and May 1948, but, of course, there were also hostile actions by the Jews during this same period. So is there a particular incident Morris can point to as having marked the initiation of these hostilities? 
In fact, in his book 1948 , he does point to a specific event. Early in the morning on November 30â€”the day after Resolution 181 was adopted in the UN General Assemblyâ€”an eight-man armed band from Jaffa ambushed a Jewish bus near Kfar Syrkin, killing five. Half an hour later, the gang attacked a second bus, killing two more. â€œThese were the first dead of the 1948 Warâ€, Morris writes. 
Yet Morris also acknowledges that these attacks were almost certainly â€œnot ordered or organized byâ€ the Arab Palestinian leadership. And â€œthe majority viewâ€ in the intelligence wing of the Haganahâ€”the Zionistsâ€™ paramilitary organization that later became the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)â€”â€œwas that the attackers were driven primarily by a desire to avengeâ€ a raid by the Jewish terrorist group Lehi, also known as the Stern Gang, on an Arab family ten days prior. Lehi â€œhad selected five males of the Shubaki family and executed them in a nearby orange groveâ€ as an act of revenge for the apparently mistaken belief that the Shubakis had informed the British authorities about a Lehi training session that prompted a British raid on the group in which five Jewish youths were killed. [20] 
So why wasnâ€™t the murder of five Arabs by the Jewish terrorist organization the initiating act of hostility marking the start of the 1948 war, in Morrisâ€™s account? 
Clearly, to try to assess responsibility for the war by pinpointing this or that incident of tit-for-tat violence is an exercise in futility. Moreover, apart from overlooking the Zionistsâ€™ own acts of hostility, Morrisâ€™s claim that the Arabs started the war serves to remove the mutual hostilities that broke out in the wake of the General Assemblyâ€™s adoption of Resolution 181 from their larger contextâ€”and it is only within that larger context that a proper assessment of which side bore greater responsibility for the war can be made. 
As in the above example, Morris tends to portray Jewish violence against Arabs as always being preceded by Arab violence against Jewsâ€”even though, as just illustrated, it was equally true that the Arab violence had, in turn, been preceded by Jewish violence. Elsewhere, in contrast to how he characterizes Arab violence, Morris describes unambiguous war crimes committed by the Zionist forces as merely â€œmistakesâ€. 
Included among the Haganahâ€™s â€œmistakesâ€ was an attack on December 18, 1947, on the village of Khisas. Carried out with the approval of Yigal Allon, the commander of the Palmach (an elite unit within the Jewish army), Zionist forces invaded the village and indiscriminately murdered seven men, a woman, and four children. Morris describes this as a â€œreprisalâ€ for the murder of a Jewish cart driver earlier that day, even though, as he superfluously notes, â€œNone of the dead appear to have been involved in the death of the cart driver.â€ [21] 
Another of the Haganahâ€™s â€œmistakesâ€ occurred on the night of January 5, 1948, when Zionist forces entered the West Jerusalem neighborhood of Katamon and bombed the Semiramis Hotel, killing twenty-six civilians, including a government official from Spain. â€œThe explosion triggered the start of a â€panic exodusâ€™ from the prosperous Arab neighborhood.â€ The British were furious, and Ben-Gurion subsequently removed the officer responsible from command. [22] Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war (Source: Hanini.org / CC BY 3.0 ) 
â€œBut generallyâ€, Morris continues, â€œHaganah retaliatory strikes during December 1947â€“March 1948 were accurately directed, either against perpetrators or against their home basesâ€â€”meaning the Arab villages where they lived. Thus, according to Morrisâ€™s own criteria, when the Haganah attacked an Arab village that happened to be home to one or more combatants and proceeded to go about â€œaccuratelyâ€ killing innocent civilians and destroying their homes, this was by no means a â€œmistakeâ€. 
Instructively, Morris quotes a document from the intelligence wing of the Haganah on the consequences of what he describes as the â€œJewish reprisalsâ€ that occurred during those months: â€œThe main effect of these operations was on the Arab civilian population â€ (emphasis added), the Haganah noted, including â€œthe destruction of their housesâ€ and psychological trauma. Among other consequences, â€œThe Jewish attacks forced the Arabs to tie down great forces in protecting themselves â€ (emphasis added). [23] Thus Morrisâ€™s characterization of Arabs as the aggressors and the Haganah as being on the defensive throughout this period is contradicted by his own account, citing primary source evidence that precisely the opposite was true. 
Indeed, Morris goes into considerable detail documenting how, in his own summation, â€œthe Yishuv had organized for war. The Arabs hadnâ€™t.â€ [24] 
Morrisâ€™s characterization of the Arabs as always being the aggressors and the Jews as being on the defensive, despite occasional â€œmistakesâ€ such as those just noted, extends well prior to the onset of the 1948 war. While Lehiâ€™s murder of five members of the Shubaki family on November 20 seems to fit Morrisâ€™s criteria for a â€œmistakeâ€, he could, in turn, also point to Arab attacks on Jews that had occurred well prior to that incident. 
He writes, for example, that in the spring and summer of 1939 the Irgun Zvai Leumi, â€œwhich had been formed by activist breakaways from the Haganah, subjected the Arab towns to an unnerving campaign of retaliatory terrorism, with special Haganah units adding to the bloodshed through selective reprisals â€ (emphasis added). [25] Once again we see that, while Morris doesnâ€™t try to justify such acts of terrorism, he does characterize them as only occurring in retaliation for earlier acts of aggression by Arabs. 
Indeed, Morris could go back a decade prior, within this exercise of trying to pinpoint responsibility for the initiation of such tit-for-tat violence, and point to the 1929 massacre of Jews in Hebron; or, further, to May 1921, when Arab mobs murdered Jews in Jaffa; or further still, to April 1920, when Arab rioters killed five Jews in Jerusalem. 
There is no dispute that these earlier incidences of violence were initiated by Arabs. But the question remains of why they occurred. Did these murderous attacks reflect an inherent hatred of Jews among the Arab population? Or is there some other context that the debate Morris has had with his critics is still missing?

Those were questions the British occupiers asked themselves and conducted inquiries to try to answer. The inquiry into the outbreak of violence in 1921, the Haycraft Commission, determined that â€œthere is no inherent anti-Semitism in the country, racial or religious. We are credibly assured by educated Arabs that they would welcome the arrival of well-to-do and able Jews who could help to develop the country to their advantage of all sections of the community.â€ [26] The outbreaks, rather, reflected the growing apprehension and resentment among the Arabs toward the Zionist project to reconstitute Palestine into a â€œJewish stateâ€â€”and in so doing to displace or otherwise disenfranchise and the landâ€™s majority Arab population. 
Nor were the Arabsâ€™ fears unfounded; indeed, the Zionists were quite open about their intentions. When the acting Chairman of the Zionist Commission was interviewed, for example, â€œhe was perfectly frank in expressing his view of the Zionist ideal. . . . In his opinion there can only be one National Home in Palestine, and that a Jewish one, and no equality in the partnership between Jews and Arabs, but a Jewish predominance as soon as the numbers of that race are sufficiently increased.â€ [27] 
The Shaw Commission inquiring into the cause of the 1929 violence arrived at the same conclusion and further observed: 
In less than ten years three serious attacks have been made by Arabs on Jews. For eighty years before the first of these attacks there is no recorded instance of any similar incidents. It is obvious then that the relations between the two races during the past decade must have differed in some material respect from those which previously obtained. Of this we found ample evidence. The reports of the Military Court and of the local Commission which, in 1920 and in 1921 respectively, enquired into the disturbances of those years, drew attention to the change in the attitude of the Arab population towards the Jews in Palestine. This was borne out by the evidence tendered during our enquiry when representatives of all parties told us that before the War the Jews and Arabs lived side by side if not in amity, at least with tolerance, a quality which to-day is almost unknown in Palestine. [28] 
Morris likewise notes in 1948 that the attacks were chiefly motivated by â€œthe fear and antagonism toward the Zionist enterpriseâ€: â€œThe bouts of violence of 1920, 1921, and 1929 were a prelude to the far wider, protracted eruption of 1936â€“1939, the (Palestine) Arab Revolt. Again, Zionist immigration and settlementâ€”and the prospect of the Judaization of the country and possibly genuine fears of ultimate displacementâ€”underl
