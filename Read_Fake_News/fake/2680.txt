ISIS Takes Out M1A Abrams Tank with American TOW Missile (video) â€¹ â€ Bio by Jack Heart : My earliest memories were of being surrounded by machinery and a constant deep mechanical humming rose and fell like the breath of fitful sleep. Maybe it was the "mother ship" or the "Montauk underground" like Preston Nichols author of the The Montauk Projects would later claim but I am inclined to believe it was the post natal care room at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn where I was born to a well to do family. I grew up in Brooklyn. My father had a Fur business on Twenty-Seventh Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan. The city bought him and his partners out when they built the Fashion Institute of Technology. From grades one to five I attended the finest Catholic school in NYC. Before I was 12 my family moved to Amity Harbor Long Island and from there the volume on the strangeness was turned up full blast. My teenage years were spent working on fishing boats at Montauk Point where my father had been stationed at Camp Hero for the Korean War. Back home in Amityville we would wile away the night doing performance art for tourists milling around outside my best friendâ€™s home gawking at the Amityville Horror House, some of you may have already met me I was one of the guys throwing beer bottles at you. Butchy to this day doesnâ€™t know who was up in that room with him that night, nobody does but I can take a real good guess. By the time I was eighteen I realized that globalism had made the seas off Long Island barren and I would have to find a new way in life to make a living. I had always wanted to be a fisherman but I opened a landscaping business with my mother who was the top woman designer in her field. Our clients included many celebrities and denizens of Long islands gold coast. Back then it seemed life would always be good. I remember one day while dragging trees out some stock brokerâ€™s yard he pulled up his long driveway in his convertible sports car. I looked at his decaying body not much older than mine. Then I looked down at mine. Salty sweat encased sinewy bronze muscles pumped full of blood from the days exertion. I decided I was just where I wanted to be. He would make his 500$ for the day and he had to give it to me because there was no way he was dragging that tree down his long driveway. Little did I know that he and his tribal brethren had a plan. Over the next twenty years they would flood America with illegal â€œimmigrantsâ€ to do my job for a hundred dollars a day. Things are not so good anymore even with an associateâ€™s degree in architectural engineering Iâ€™ll never make 500$ a day again. He makes more because now the government that sold me out, not once but three times subsidizes his job. I wonder how many of his tribe are buried in veterans memorial cemeteryâ€™s. Practically every male member of my family is. I ended up on the wrong side of the law when I was 27 years old through no fault of my own. I was helping Geraldo Rivera film what I now realize must have been Ollie North's little cocaine contra excursion into NY. It was never aired. He quit his job but I was beaten and tortured by the police then branded as a felon for the rest of my life. In 1987 I was asked to remove the Pagans motorcycle gang from their clubhouse a strip club named Bogartâ€™s. The person that asked me was Richard Capri who died abruptly a few years back. He owned Bogart's and a lot of other strip clubs on Long Island. He was a prominent figure in New York's underworld. Financially he dwarfed people like Gotti and the rest of the menagerie of mutts paraded on TV as â€œmob bosses.â€ It was during that period that I realized I was a member of a very elite unit. Some would call us soldiers of God others the army of Satan. You read what I write and you decide. LUCIFER in the Temple of the Dog II By Jack Heart on October 29, 2016 The Human Race has no worse Enemy than Institutional Academia, whose only real job is to Dissemble its Past By Jack Heart, Orage & Friends 
Itâ€™s ironic, science finally knows enough about science to disprove itself. But as the Norsemen well knew, that is the fate of all things, just like their gods who in the end must annihilate themselvesâ€¦ Marcel Griaule with the Dogon 
From 1931 â€“ 1956 the legendary French anthropologist Marcel Griaule, along with Germaine Dieterlen â€“ a brilliant and highly accomplished anthropologist in her own right â€“ studied a West African tribe called the Dogon. After eighteen years of studies, they made their first breakthrough into the Dogonâ€™s secrets in 1950 and published Un Systeme Soudanais de Sirius.* 
What was in that document should have changed this world, but it was quickly countered by those in academia who are paid to keep this world just the way it is. 
What Griaule and Dieterlen found in their quarter century of research, shockingly enough, as the holographic universe had not yet been proposed, was the source of its projection. They found the â€Black Sunâ€™ in the shadow of Timbuktu, the ancient seat of the anglophileâ€™s most abyssal nightmare, there dwell the Dogon, pun intended. What the Dog people believe explains how the Holographic Universe works and gives a dissertation of the rock carving in Australiaâ€™s Blue Mountains; almost seven thousand miles from the eastern coastline of Africaâ€¦ 
Nobody noticed then and they havenâ€™t yet . They are still trying to explain how a tribe of primitive Black farmers from Africa knew more about astronomy than the twentieth centuryâ€™s best White scientists. All they can come up with to date is two of the greatest anthropologists the world has ever produced lied and falsified all their data. 
The â€œproofâ€ they cite for this kind of unprecedented scholastic slander is the â€œresearchâ€ of Dutch Mormon and neophyte anthropologist; Walter E. A. van Beek. Van Beek converted to Mormonism in college when he started studying anthropologyâ€¦ 55 
Van Beekâ€™s research consisted of dropping in on the Dogon almost a half century after Griaule and Dieterlen, who studied them when they still had their independence through France. By the time van Beek got there, the Dogon lived in an Islamic State, at the same latitude in an Africa that in a little over a decade after he published would give the world Darfur. 
In Darfur in 2003, Arab Sudanese Muslims displaced and murdered close to a half million Black Sudanese â€infidels.â€™ 
Van Beek asked a few questions about a secret tradition that the Dogon already knew was anathema to their Muslim overlords, then proceeded to publish a paper in 1991 that amounts to nothing more than an ad hominem attack on the two great anthropologists. In it, he repeatedly states that he could not confirm any of Griauleâ€™s and Dieterlenâ€™s findings and insinuates that they made the whole thing up.56 Although seemingly written with a crayon, van Beekâ€™s paper has been given utterly unjustified academic status. This type of slander is typical of the Mormons, a powerful and extremely wealthy Christian sect. The Mormons act out their pathological hatred of Blacks academically. It is the foundation of Mormon theological doctrine that the Lamanites or Blacks once wiped out the Nephites or Whites in the Americas. 
According to the Mormons, both Whites and the Blacks had settled America by way of Israel. They believe Native Americans are the descendants of Blacks. The Mormons also believe in and have been asked repeatedly by the ADL to stop baptizing their favorite dead Jews so that they too can go the heaven and become gods like good Mormonsâ€¦ The rest of the Church of the Latter Day Saintsâ€™ strange costumes and beliefs has been well documentedâ€¦ S«rius A and below it to the left, S«rius B 
Every sixty years Sirius , or Sigi Tolo (Star of Yasigi) to the Dogon, appears between two mountain peaks and the Dogon celebrate Sigui which can last several years. The last Sigui began in 1967 and the festivities didnâ€™t end till 1973. 
Sirius is a star in Canis Major in the southern celestial firmament; itâ€™s pronounced S«rius in Latin, and is derived from the ancient Greek word Seirios, which means glowing or Scorcher. It is the brightest star in the night sky, just about twice as bright as the next brightest; Canopus in the southern constellation of Carina. 
As it rose over the horizon of the Mesopotamian valley, S«rius was known as the Dog of Orion, because it always trailed closely behind the constellation of Orion â€“ called Neph®lâ€² by the ancient inhabitants of a city currently known as Aleppo. S«rius is now known in the West simply as the Dog Star. 
Neph®lâ€² was considered to be the origin of the Nephilim or Watchers, the Angels in the bible who came down to earth to interbreed with the daughters of men and teach the human race the art of civilization. As a reward for their altruism, the children of the Watchers were drowned in the deluge by a giggling Yahweh over the objections of the prophet Enoch. In the homeland of the Norse, S«rius is known as Lokabrenna or Lokiâ€™s Torch. To the Tohono Oâ€™odham, a Native American tribe who live just south of the Hopi in Arizonaâ€™s baking Sonoran Desert; S«rius is a dog that stalks the mountain sheep. In the East they have other names for S«rius. The Chinese call it Tinlng; the Celestial Wolf. In Sanskrit S«rius is known simply as Lubdhaka; the Hunterâ€¦ 
In springtime around the Mediterranean and North Africa, S«rius sinks below the horizon and disappears from the night sky for seventy days. Itâ€™s reappearance in ancient Egypt right before sunrise on the eastern horizon toward the latter part of July heralded not only the morning, but also the flooding of the banks of the Nile. S«rius was both yearned for and feared, because it could cause great destruction and at the same time brought with it the rich volcanic topsoil of the Ethiopian highlands to fertilize the Nile Delta. The fertility of the Nile Valley was the driving mechanism behind the great Egyptian civilizations. 
To the ancient Greeks , the first appearance of S«rius right before the morning heralded the coming of the â€œDog Daysâ€ of summer. The Greeks feared the sweltering heat of those days under its influence, days of madness in dogs, wilted crops, weakened warriors and lustful women. To the Aborigine of Australiaâ€™s Blue Mountains, July was the time where S«rius set right after the sun and rose right before the dawn to announce the morning. 
Un Systeme Soudanais de Sirius then introduces Po Tolo (Star of Fonio), which orbits perpendicular to the horizon of Sigi Tolo. When Po Tolo is closest to Sigi Tolo, it is at its most brilliant, and when it is furthest away, it gives off a scintillation that makes it appear as many stars. Irregularities of motion in Sirius star system X ray image of S«rius and above it, slightly to the right, S«rius B 
In 1844, a German astronomer observed the tell tale irregularities in the motion of S«rius through the firmament, indicating it is a binary star system, when two objects circle around each other in the night sky. 
Twenty-first century scientists assert that this is due to their gravitational pull on each other, but no one has ever proven how gravity works, no one of course except the Marquis de Laplace. The late eighteenth century French mathematician had neither need nor use for intervention from Newtonâ€™s â€Devine Artificerâ€™ to keep the universe from destroying itself. 
Instead of postulating that gravity was the result of an attraction between two points and which would require periodic adjustments by god to keep the heavens from self destruction, as Newton insisted, Laplace said the universe was held together by a fluidic field. Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace (1745-1827) 
Laplace then went on to prove it with a series of eloquently presented equations in Exposition du syst¨me du monde and the M©canique c©leste. His breakthrough mathematics in Th©orie analytique des probabilities , published in 1812, would lead to the use of the probability equations that would culminate with the math of twentieth century Germany. 
He was the first man to recognize that somewhere in the universe there must exist Black Holes, whose attraction was so great that not even light could resist the summoning their relentless call. 
Objects do not attract each other; they distort the spacetime continuum through their mass. Itâ€™s this distortion that is perceived and measured as a force. Itâ€™s just a word. There is no gravity as Newton described it or any omnificent omnipresent god as Judeo-Christians describe â€œhimâ€¦â€ 
Binary star systems were by then already well known to scientists, but whatever S«rius was rotating around, it could not be seen with the lenses available at the time. Dubbed S«rius B by academia, the Dark Stars existence would not be optically confirmed till 1862 with a prototype eighteen and a half inch refracting telescope being field tested by its American inventor. 
Scintillation usually occurs through atmospheric conditions, but in the Holographic Paradigm it is the collision of spherical frequency waves that generate photons â€” the points of light that constitute what academia erroneously call particles. As S«rius and S«rius B perpetually circle around each other in the inky darkness, spherical frequency waves are exactly what are being generated, just like they are by this worldâ€™s Sun. The Dogon told Griaule that Polo Tolo is the origin of all things and that its contents are ejected by centrifugal force in infinitely small particles which upon exiting Polo Tolo can grow to the same size as Polo Tolo within a day. They told him Polo Tolo is the smallest of all things, yet the heaviest of all stars. They calculate the orbit of Polo Tolo around Sigi Tolo in doubles which is a hundred years for every two orbits and it turns on itself every year. The Dogon believe Polo Tolo is white where as Sigi Tolo is red. 
Most of that will be the subject of endless conjecture by guys who wear glasses an inch thick, never in their pathetic excuses for a life slept with a cheerleader and canâ€™t think outside of a text book. Itâ€™s all possible but not provable. 
Other than mapping the movements of points of light through the firmament, most of what is left in astronomy is a quintessential pseudoscience. It operates outside all established laws of empirical science. Its current best known proponent is Hollywood actor Morgan Freeman. As it is now practiced twenty-first century astronomyâ€™s founding father Carl Sagan dressed and acted more like a Detroit pimp than an Ivy League scientist. 
To borrow a quip from Frank Zappa about the relationship of politics to the military industrial complex; NASA is the entertainment division of Jet Propulsions Laboratory (JPL). 
JPL is an organization founded through the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) by master Magi Jack Parsons and Theodore von Krmn, blood heir to the Maharal of Prague; one of the two most powerful Qabalists to ever walk the earth. The other was Aleister Crowley, Jack Parsonsâ€™ mentor in Magickâ€¦ 
Optical observation has determined that S«rius and S«rius B orbit each other at a separation of about 50.1 years. As they do, they emit an unexpectedly high level of infrared radiation, with S«rius B being brighter in the infrared spectrum than S«rius. 
S«rius B has been described by scientists as a white dwarf . Itâ€™s about the same size as the earth; and by 1910, its mass had been determined by observations of its binary orbit around S«rius to be about the same as the sun, making it a million times denser than the sun. A tablespoon of S«rius B would weigh five tons. 
S«rius was described as red by Roman astronomer and astrologist; Claudius Ptolemy. His observations are backed by the writings of the poet Aratus, the orator Cicero, and general Germanicus. Seneca the Younger described S«rius as being a deeper red than even Mars. These observations by notable historical figures at the dawn of the Common Era are backed by Lombard prayer manuscripts from as late as the eighth century. During the same period, S«rius was the standard star for the color white to Chinese astronomers. In present times, S«rius glows a vivid white-blue in every far off corner of the world, but to the naked eye, it sometimes appears to be flashing with red, white and blue hues when near the horizon. 
According to Einsteinâ€™s general relativity, because of its extreme density, the light waves from S«rius B should be gravitationally red-shifted. This was confirmed in 1925. Gravitational red-shifting is when electromagnetic radiation, emanating in spherical frequency waves from a source in the gravitational field, is reduced in frequency when seen from a place that has a higher gravitational potential. Red-shifting is a direct result of gravitational time dilation which is the difference of elapsed time between events to observers at different distances from the gravitational mass they are observing. 
This manifests itself as a change in the color perception of light toward the red part of the light spectrum as the wavelength is increased. An increase in the frequency observed from a position that has a lower gravitational potential than the source results in a shift to the blue part. Due to its extreme density, the only thing with a higher gravitational potential than a White Dwarf would be a Neutron Star, a Dark Star or a Black Holeâ€¦ 
Systeme Soudanais de Sirius goes on to say that there is another star the Dogon call Emme Ya (Sorghum Female). It is four times lighter than Polo Tolo and follows a vaster trajectory in the same direction and the same time, also taking fifty years to complete an orbit. Their positions are where their rays make right angles. Emme Ya emits rays which have the quality of solar rays and is accompanied through its orbit by a satellite named Nyan Tolo (Star of Woman). 
Data began piling up at the dawn of the twentieth century; â€œobservational as well as physical and dynamical indicationsâ€ that â€œled to the hypothesis of the existence of a third body in the system.â€ 57 By 1932, it was pretty well established through orbital calculations that something was revolving roughly every 6.3 years around either S«rius or S«rius B. 
During the previous decade a tiny star had been sighted about twenty times by some of the best astronomers in the business. However the star was like a â€œphantom,â€ nobody ever saw it twice or long enough to confirm it.58 
By 1995, using additional data and three different systems of math figures of 6.4 years, six and finally six using Fourier analysis were arrived at for a complete revolution of the â€“as of yetâ€“ unidentified star. Further analysis of the possible orbital scenarios indicates that â€œstable orbits with a period of about 6 years exist only around Sirius A.â€59 Because it cannot be optically observed, the mass of S«rius C would have to be about twenty or thirty times larger than Jupiter, which is the bare minimum to support thermonuclear fusion.60 What the math and optical observation says about the 3-star system of S«rius, the question mark is for Nyan Tolo, in English the Star of Woman [or the Moon] Unless of course, the third star in the S«rius system is a Black Hole or what Newtonian physics calls a Dark Star. Black holes are a generic prediction of general relativity; no oneâ€™s ever actually seen one. How could you? The black hole is a point in the spacetime continuum where the gravitational effects are so strong that not even electromagnetic radiation such as light can escape.
There is nothing to see. But in general relativity, a black hole does have mass and angular momentum, so its presence can be detected through its gravitational interaction with other stars and its effects on electromagnetic radiation such as light. 
In 1974 Stephen Hawking, by applying quantum field theory to general relativity, predicted that black holes would emit small amounts of thermal radiation, light in a perfect black body spectrumâ€¦ Many other famous mathematicians and scientists have since verified Hawkingâ€™s resultsâ€¦ 
According to general relativity , there is a singularity in the center of a black hole that is infinitely dense. Once across the black holes event horizon nothing can escape that singularity. The inevitable can be prolonged by an object accelerating away maybe even by jumping through time, but sooner or later it will reach freefall and be torn apart in a process so violent that it is sometimes referred to as spaghettification or the noodle effect by scientists. In the end, it is crushed into something so dense it is infinite. 
In general relativity, there is a yawning black hole at the center of the galaxy sustained by the essences of the all the worlds that it has destroyed. Everything corporeal is destined to one day be swept over its event horizon. The black hole sits like an ever expanding open drain at the bottom of the ocean. 
All matter must, in due time, be crushed into the infinite density that feeds its primordial singularity. It is the fate of all that is to be crushed back into what H. P. Lovecraft called â€œthe crawling chaosâ€¦â€ 
There really is not much difference between a black hole and a wormhole, if any at all. In relativity, they both have a singularity in the center and all that crosses their event horizon ends by being crushed into Lovecraftâ€™s crawling chaos. In 1988 scientists working out of the Caltech found loopholes in the math that predicts singularities and Lorentzian traversable wormholes became a mathematical probability. Lorentzian traversable wormholes 
Lorentzian traversable wormholes allow travel in both directions from one part of the universe to another very quickly. They also allow travel from one universe to anotherâ€¦ 
According to the math that JPL uses, teleportation is far more likely than dissolution for an object that passes through a worm hole or a black hole. To quote well-known television physicist Michio Kaku, there is no reason why an object could not â€œpass freely back and forth. In fact, for one solution, the trip through a wormhole would be no worse than riding in a plane.â€ 61 
The Dogon believe that Sirius B once occupied the place where our Sun is now. Twenty-first century astronomers object. They say that this is impossible! But it should be apparent by now that the Dogon know more about the universe than twenty-first century astronomy. 
The thousand year war Truth has waged against academia and all the other agents of the great Abrahamic lie ends with the Dogon. The Dogon are the remnants of ancient Egypt. The Egyptians were Black! To paraphrase Aleister Crowley in the Holy Books they were Black as Nubian slaves so they could absorb more of the light of Godâ€¦ 
It is fitting to paraphrase Crowley because he himself was a product of the Plymouth Brethren, the same rabidly anglophile and ruthlessly committed fundamental Christian sect that gave the world Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie. 
â€Sirâ€™ Flinders Petrie was the most prominent archeologist of the nineteenth century and the British Empires academic heavyweight champion, despite the fact that Wallace Budge was a far better scientist. Petrieâ€™s racism and Christian fanaticism have been immortalized in books. Many have chuckled over the fact that when Petrie died he would donate his head to science, and science would lose it. What Petrie and all his academic allies were pedaling directly in the face of far more accomplished scientists like Frenchmen Auguste Mariette and Gaston Maspero along with their English counterpart the great Wallace Budge, was Anglo-Israelism. 
Since the day of John Dee, Anglo-Israelism has been the unseen current driving the tides of blood and war that have swept first England then America to world hegemony. It is the fanatical belief by the British and their progeny that they are the lineal descendents of the Israelites and that the throne of England can be traced back to the House of David. Therefore the people of the British Isles are Yahwehâ€™s chosen people in the bible. 
Anglo-Israelisms adherents believe that the â€œTen Tribes were transferred to Babylon about 720 B.C.; and simultaneously, according to Herodotus, the Scythians, including the tribe of the Sacc¦, appeared in the same district; the progenitors of the Saxons afterward passed over into Denmarkâ€”the â€œmarkâ€ or country of the tribe of Danâ€”and thence to England. 
Another branch of the tribe of Dan which remained â€œin shipsâ€ (Judges, v. 17) made its appearance in Ireland under the title of â€œTuatha-da-Danan.â€ Tephi, a descendant of the royal house of David, arrived in Ireland, according to the native annals, in 580 B.C. From her was descended Feargus More, king of Argyll, an ancestor of Queen Victoria, who thus fulfilled the prophecy that â€œthe line of David shall rule for ever and everâ€ (II Chron. xiii. 5, xxi. 7). 
The Irish branch of the Danites brought with them Jacobâ€™s stone, which has always been used as coronation stone of the kings of Scotland and England, and is now preserved in Westminster Abbey. Somewhat inconsistently, the prophecy that the Canaanites should trouble Israel (Num. xxxiii. 55, Josh. xxiii. 13) is applied to the Irish. The land of Arzareth, to which the Israelites were transplanted (II Esd. xiii. 45), is identified with Ireland by dividing the former name into two parts, the former of which is ere“, or â€œlandâ€; the latter, Ar, or â€œIre.â€â€62 
As the agents of Anglo-Israelism , what Petrie and the rest of academia were teaching at western universities was the systematic destruction of an entire racesâ€™ heritage in the name of another racesâ€™ fantasy. No one ever really got it, except R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz â€” there are things in Egypt far older than Egyptâ€¦ 
The institutionalized racism is blatant and it is unprecedented in everything that is known of Greek and Roman history. The Romans considered the Ethiopians a people beloved by the gods. But even for the most committed anglophile there is a blind rage, a fanatical meanness to it that borders on stupidity. 
Blacks are not intelligent enough to have built anything besides a mud hut and surely an unknown â€œDynastic Race,â€ a â€œfineâ€ lighter-complexioned race had invaded Egypt from the south in late predynastic times conquering the â€œinferiorâ€ and â€œexhaustedâ€ indigenous dark skinned savages. 63 
This Aryan race of fine White men, no doubt the Israelites of the bible, then slowly introduced dynastic civilization through interbreeding with the local â€œmulattoâ€ race and culminated it from the fourth dynasty on with the building of all the great edifices in Egypt.64 
Viewed under this lens of religious fanaticism , Colonel Howard Vyseâ€™s sacking and defiling of the Giza plateau toward the middle of the ninetieth century and academiaâ€™s enshrinement of him for his acts of wanton vandalism â€“although still totally unacceptableâ€“ are at least understandable, as is Thomas Youngâ€™s forgery, when he inserted the glyph for Ra to complete Khafraâ€™s name on the Dream Stele. 
Literacy had always been frowned upon by Christianity, but with the advent of the printing press, it became unavoidable. If a world that knew how to read was ever to believe the outlandish lies that are told in the bible, it wouldnâ€™t do to have evidence that contradicted the biblesâ€™ narrative staring that newly literate world dead in the face. 
Dr. J. J. Hurtak was NASAâ€™s guru in the latter quarter of the twentieth century, and the man the authors of the Stargate Conspiracy point to as the supreme puppeteer of the Giza plateau in that same period. During that stretch of time in the eighties and nineties Hurtak was secretly teaching close friends â€œthe pyramids are hundreds of thousands of years oldâ€¦â€ 
France was pushing back at Anglo-Israelismsâ€™ deliberate dissembling and falsification of history with Auguste Mariette and Gaston Maspero, who in tandem managed to control the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities until WWI. 
Germany was already at war with the Jewish impersonators, but even before that, as the center for Panbabylonism in Europe, German scholars had quietly seethed and trained a blue-blooded scholar like James Henry Breasted. James Henry Breasted 
Breasted could not just be dismissed like a common academic, not with friends like Gertrude Bell, who was the British master spy that along with Lawrence of Arabia established the Hashemite dynasties, Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon, the men charged with looting the Tomb of Tutankhamen, Lord Allenby the man who would wrest control of the middle east from the Ottomans and the Arab leader Faisal whom they would eventually crown king of Iraq. 
The battle of the pyramids was coming to a head by the time a seizure prone psychic with a Masonic pedigree named Edgar Cayce showed up promoting Anglo-Israelism as a journey through Atlantis and a time forgotten to a New World Order. 
War had already broken out between the Saxons, a war which would finish the Ottoman Empire for good and leave the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Jews in complete control of the Giza plateau and all the rest of the Middle East. 
Control of the Giza plateau is maintained to this day through the Association for Research and Enlightenment (A.R.E.), a legacy of the seizure-prone psychic. Control of the rest of the Middle East is maintained through instigation of perpetual war and unrest. 
France was still pushing back hard when Harvey Spencer Lewis would found the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC) in America on behalf of the French Rosicrucianâ€™s. In the thirties AMORC, allied with big money, started printing ancient maps detailing a network of tunnels and chambers beneath the Giza plateau and distributing them to anyone who bought their books. 
Lewis of course claimed they were ancient Rosicrucian secrets but French archaeologist Emile Baraize had been to the Giza plateau by 1926, almost a decade before the maps were published. Baraize during a period from twenty-six onwards had done extensive explorations beneath the plateau that were never published for academia. At the same time Lewis was peddling his maps, Griaule and Dieterlen showed up at the Dogons doorstepâ€¦ 
In The Shadow out of Time, Lovecraft wrot e about a man troubled by strange dreams and visions of a race hundreds of thousands of years old. They had driven an even older race that had long preyed on them into the labyrinth of the earthâ€™s interior. The most ancient race had long since evolved to prefer the labyrinth and no longer needed anything from the surface, but they had never forgotten that they required revenge. It is in Australiaâ€™s great western desert where the man to his eternal horror finds the entrance into the labyrinth. 
If Anglo-Israelism has a poet laureate, it is HP Lovecraft. They are not ignorant of the occults deepest secrets. It was their great high priest Charles Piazzi Smyth who orchestrated Waynman Dixon and Dr. James Grants â€œdiscoveryâ€ of the shafts in the Queens Chamber in 1872. Dixon and Grant knew almost exactly where those shafts were, shafts that had been walled up before history begins. Occult knowledge like that shows there are those in Anglo-Israelism that know their way around the labyrinth all too wellâ€¦ 
It was Lovecraftâ€™s job to take those things which they knew were in the labyrinth and which they saw as their enemies and paint them in colors of the most abyssal horror the human soul is capable of. Lovecraft did this with almost supernatural efficiency in stories like the Shadow over Innsmouth, the Dunwich Horror and many many more. In the Call of Cthulhu Lovecraft creates his own mythos about the â€œold onesâ€ and the â€œunspeakable terrorâ€ they are poised to bring back to the world of White Christians when the stars, on an inevitable day of doom, align in their favor. 
Lovecraft saw terrifying conspiracies to bring back these old ones everywhere he lookedâ€¦ But outside of bat winged humanoids and certain blue blooded families sequestered around the New England countryside, Lovecraft saw secret societies among the colored races as the primary high priests and harbingers of the old ones. Lovecraft detests and fears all dark-skinned people as the people of Cthulhu and the old ones. 
In Herbert West-Reanimator Lovecraft expresses his revulsion at the idea of bringing a Black man back to life when he writes: â€œand Buck Robinson, â€œThe Harlem Smoke.â€ The Negro had been knocked out and a momentâ€™s examination shewed us he would permanentl
