Pupils at a primary school were forced to chant â€œAllahu Akhbarâ€ and â€œthere is no God but Allahâ€, an appalled father has claimed. 
The father of the pupil at the girlâ€™s primary school in German ski resort Garmisch-Partenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given. 
He claimed she had been â€œforcedâ€ by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24. 
The handout read: â€œOh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.â€ â€¦ 
The incident comes just weeks after parents complained to German newspaper Hessian Nieders¤chsische Allgemeine (HNA) that their childrenâ€™s nursery was refusing to acknowledge â€œChristmas ritualsâ€ to accommodate the â€œdiverse culturesâ€ of other pupils.
