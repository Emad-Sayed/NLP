Donald Trumpâ€™s star took a beating Wednesday morning â€” literally. 
The reality TV hostâ€™s Hollywood Walk of Fame star was destroyed by a vandal rendering the fixture completely unreadable, according to Deadline Hollywood . 
The vandal was dressed in a city construction worker, taking his sledgehammer to the five-point brass star at approximately 5:45 am. 
The man reportedly said he wanted to remove the souvenir so that it could be auctioned off, with the proceeds set to go toward helping the women who have come forward in recent weeks to accuse Trump of sexual assault. 
The allegations all came out after a 2005 recording surfaced of Trump claiming that his â€œstarâ€ status allows him to grope and kiss women whenever he wants. 
While this is the first time a star has been completely defaced, Trumpâ€™s has been vandalized at least twice since he announced his presidential run a year and a half ago.
