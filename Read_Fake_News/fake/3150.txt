Tuesday 1 November 2016 by Formelia Alberthine West Ham fans laud aerodynamic properties of new pound coin 
West Ham fans have thanked the Royal Mint for its efforts in improving the match-day experience at the London Stadium with the release of a new more aerodynamic pound coin. 
Many season ticket holders claim its enhanced aerodynamic design, could see its distance and accuracy improve significantly. 
A Royal Mint spokesperson explained, â€œThere is a reason golf balls arenâ€™t completely flat, these imperfections on the surface actually reward the more skilful throwers. Youâ€™re welcome.â€ 
After a spate of crowd disturbances at the ground, Hammers fans had complained of a return to the dark days of the early eighties, where only â€unpredictableâ€™ circular coins could be deployed as missiles at games. 
West Ham fan Simon Williams congratulated the Royal Mint on the technological advances which have seen multiple â€stabilisingâ€™ edges introduced. 
He told us, â€œIâ€™m reasonably confident that with this new coin I could pick out the skull of an opposition player, or supporter for that matter, from way up in the gods. 
â€œTheyâ€™re quite weighty â€“ I had become accustomed to launching 20pâ€™s, but they only leave flesh wounds â€“ these babies could do serious brain damage. 
â€œObviously itâ€™s difficult to inflict brain damage upon Millwall fans, but it will be fun trying! 
West Ham vice-chair Karen Brady hoped the temptation to start launching whole pounds could see match day takings increase significantly. 
â€œListen, if they want to start targeting the directorsâ€™ seats then please, by all means, do so. 
â€œIn fact, Iâ€™d like to see all denominations of our fabled currency â€go coinâ€™. 
â€œIf someone could chuck us a £50 weâ€™d happily throw Andy Carroll back at them in retaliation.â€ Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently
