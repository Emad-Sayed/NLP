The â€defenseâ€™ budget is three quarters of a trillion dollars. Profits went up last year well over 25%. I guarantee you: when war becomes that profitable, weâ€™re going to see more of it. â€“ Chalmers Johnson 
Until it is no longer the case that M ost US C itizens H ave N o I dea W hat O ur G overnment D oes O r W ho I t S erves , I am just going to continue to insist that #muchniwogdowis is simply the GREATEST ACRONYM EVAR â„¢!!!11!!! Todayâ€™s demonstration of its awesomeness is an Op-Ed in The Nation by former Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) entitled Why Is the Foreign Policy Establishment Spoiling for More War? Look at Their Donors . He is â€œfed up with the DC policy elite who cash in on war while presenting themselves as experts, at the cost of other peopleâ€™s lives, our national fortune, and the sacred honor of our country.â€ 
Itâ€™s kind of adorable that Kucinich thinks our country has some sort of â€œsacred honorâ€ going for it. Nevertheless, I have always liked this d00d. 
Kucinich brought Articles of Impeachment against Dick Cheney and George W. Bush for high crimes and misdemeanors in connection with the Iraq war. His efforts went precisely nowhere (â€œimpeachment is not on our agenda.â€ -Nancy Pelosi). When he ran for president in 2008, Kucinichâ€™s platform included : single-payer universal health care; bans on offshore drilling, toxic pesticides and privatizing Social Security; legalizing pot and ending the War on Drugs; andâ€”my personal favoriteâ€”creating a cabinet-level â€œ Department of Peace â€ to foster international cooperation. That last one naturally made him the laughingstock of the beltway press, punditocracy and Congress. Thereâ€™s no money in peace FFS! Well, not for the right people anyway. NO ONE WANTS THAT. When Kucinich ran for a newly redistricted House seat in 2012, he was defeated in the Democratic primary by Marcy Kaptur (D- Forced Birth Brigades ). 
In the Op-ed Kucinich goes after DCâ€™s so-called â€œthink tanks,â€ and the Brookings Institute in particular. He notes that Brookings, â€œ in a report to Congress , admitted it received $250,000 from the US Central Command, Centcomâ€¦Pentagon money to think tanks that endorse war?â€ And the Generalsâ€™ preferred war policies isnâ€™t the only thing Brookings is shilling for: as Kucinich notes, the Food and Drug Administration, the US Department of transportation and the US Department of Health and Human Services all give moneyâ€”taxpayer moneyâ€”to Brookings, which in turn promotes these agenciesâ€™ preferred policies to Congress and the press with the sheen of academic gravitas and objectivity. 
Kuchinich says: 
â€œIt is our patriotic duty to expose why the DC foreign-policy establishment and its sponsors have not learned from their failures and instead are repeating them, with the acquiescence of the political class and sleepwalkers with press passes.â€ 
Why? Because from their perspective these are not failuresâ€”not at all. See, what informed, rational citizens who value the security and wellbeing of humanity here and around the globe might call â€œfucking epic foreign policy disasters,â€ are instead for the bipartisan DC establishment wicked smart, wildly successful, solid business decisions. 
Dennis Kucinich knows this of course; the point of his article is to shed some light on the real winners of our wars, and some of the dynamics at work that virtually ensure their continued victory. Heâ€™s just connecting the dots into a picture that anyone can see if we cared to look. Generally speaking, we donâ€™t. Itâ€™s an ugly picture. 
I think Iâ€™ll just close with the hallowed words of preeminent 20th century philosopher Boy George : 
War is stupid, and people are stupid And love means nothing in some strange quarters. 
Have a nice day. This is box title
