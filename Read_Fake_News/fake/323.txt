[11/1/16] Asked to provide a quotation for a Politico profile of Huma Abedin in July 2015, Clinton Campaign manager John Podesta wanted to use the phrase â€œwicked smartâ€ instead of â€œbright,â€ and he emphasized Abedinâ€™s â€œstrategic sense.â€ 
Podesta also agreed with a campaign stafferâ€™s suggestion to describe Abedin as â€œan integral part of the team.â€ 
The Wikileaks email exchange , dated July 2, 2015 and released on Tuesday, begins with Clintonâ€™s press secretary Nicholas Merrill telling Milia Fisher, Podestaâ€™s aide, that â€œPolitico has been working on a profile on Huma that we are being what Iâ€™d call partially cooperative with.â€ 
Merrill said after consulting with Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri and Huma herself, the campaign decided to have the reporter sit down with Huma â€œoff the record.â€ 
â€œWe think there is some value in demystifying her a bit in general, and Politico isnâ€™t a bad place to do it,â€ Merrill wrote to Fisher. 
Merrill asked Fisher to see if Podesta â€œwould be willing to weigh in, which I think would be good in the spirit of showing team unity.â€ 
â€œThe piece will be about Humaâ€™s evolution from body person to senior staffer, so if heâ€™s up for it, maybe John could say something about her being a multi-faceted team player,â€ Merrill wrote. Then he offered a suggested quotation: 
â€œLike: I was there at the White House when Huma was a young intern, and now sheâ€™s an integral part of the team. Sheâ€™s as multi-faceted as she is bright, and when you combine that with her humility, you couldnâ€™t ask for a better colleague.â€ 
Merrill tells Fisher, â€œFeel free to tweak that, put it in Johnâ€™s voice, or blow it up.â€ 
Fisher forwarded Merrillâ€™s email to Podesta, asking him if heâ€™d be willing to provide a quote. â€œComms (communications) thinks it might lend an air of community to the piece,â€ she wrote to Podesta. 
Podestaâ€™s reply: â€œChange bright to â€wicked smartâ€™ and after humilty add â€and strategic sense.'â€

The July 2, 2015 Politico profile of Abedin described her as â€œClintonâ€™s longest-serving aide.â€ It said that â€œlike a mother monitoring her child on the playground, she never let Clinton drift out of her line of sight, ever vigilant and poised to act.â€ Post navigation
