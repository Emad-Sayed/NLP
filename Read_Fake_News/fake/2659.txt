Europe Mounts Historic Challenge to Googleâ€™s Domination of Tech Services Posted on Oct 31, 2016 Jon Russell / (CC BY-SA 2.0) 
The European Commission has slapped Google with three sets of monopoly charges , starting a fight that could cost the company up to 10 percent of its annual revenue and show American firms that â€œthereâ€™s a bazooka in Europe that can be shot at companiesâ€ that seek to obtain dominant market positions. 
The New York Timesâ€™ DealBook reports: 
The cases relate to Android, Googleâ€™s mobile operating system, some of its dominant online search services and some of its advertising products. 
While each response will be couched in legalese, Googleâ€™s main argument is that its business practices do not fall afoul of the regionâ€™s tough antitrust rules and that competitors can freely offer their own rival digital services to Europeâ€™s more than 500 million consumers. 
â€œOur search engine is designed to provide the most relevant results and most useful ads for any query,â€ Kent Walker, Googleâ€™s general counsel, wrote in a blog post when previously rebutting some of Europeâ€™s antitrust charges. â€œUsers and advertisers benefit when we do this well. So does Google.â€ 
The companyâ€™s detractorsâ€”including small European start-ups, some local politicians and significant American firms like Oracleâ€”disagree with Googleâ€™s optimistic outlook. 
â€œGoogle has taken its best shot, but the European Commission has decided that itâ€™s still on the right track,â€ said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch Europe, which represents those of Googleâ€™s rivals that filed complaints against the companyâ€™s perceived dominance. 
â€œI donâ€™t doubt Google feels like it has a strong defense. But thatâ€™s what other previously dominant companies thought, too,â€ he added. 
DealBook continues: 
Whatever happens, Googleâ€™s battle in Europe will not end overnight. 
European officials must first review the companyâ€™s rebuttals, and a final decision in any of the cases is not expected until midway through 2017, at the earliest. 
If found to have breached the regionâ€™s rules, Google faces fines totaling up to $7.5 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, and may be forced to change how it operates in the 28-member bloc. While any antitrust fine is not expected to reach the maximum possible, the company is likely to appeal any European ruling, further lengthening the process. 
Yet it is this death-by-a-thousand-cuts regulatory limbo that arguably represents the biggest headache for Google.
