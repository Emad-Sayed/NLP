Miss Finland 2006 has become the 12th woman to accuse Donald Trump of sexual assault. Ninni Laaksonen claims the presidential candidate groped her while they took a picture together before an appearance on â€The Late Show with David Lettermanâ€™ 10 years ago. 
Laaksonen, now 30, told Finnish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat on Thursday that Trump groped her in New York in July 2006. A translation provided by the Daily Beast explains that the incident occurred when she and three other Miss Universe contestants were taking photos outside the Late Show studio. 
â€œ Trump stood right next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt, â€ she said. â€œ I donâ€™t think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought, â€What is happening?â€™ â€ 
The beauty queen also attended parties at Trumpâ€™s residence with Melania, whom he had married one year prior to the incident. 
â€œ Somebody told me there that Trump liked me because I looked like Melania when she was younger ,â€ she told The Telegraph. 
Trump has vowed to sue all of his accusers, calling them â€œ horrible, horrible liars .â€ However, he may have a difficult time taking Laaksonen to court, as she currently lives in Finland where she runs Ninnin Lifestyle and Living, a beauty and cosmetic company.
