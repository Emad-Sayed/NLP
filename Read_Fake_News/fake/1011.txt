A NEGLECTED wooden pallet is said to be suffering from severe self esteem issues after it failed to be selected for a nearby bonfire by local youths, WWN understands. 
The pallet, left unattended for weeks behind a Lidl was not one of 70 pallets chosen to form part of a structurally suspect bonfire pile on a field in the Waterford area of Europe, prompting the pallet to spiral into an existential spiral which saw it question its own self worth. 
â€œI donâ€™t know what I did wrong, butâ€¦ Iâ€™m obviously hideous,â€ the pallet shared, which until last month had a family of 400 cans of Polish beer living on top of it. 
â€œYou see the lads coming, pulling shapes and you think finally, Iâ€™ll feel special, feel wanted, but they never chose me. I just wanted to be doused in petrol and consumed by a raging hot fire, like any other of my kind,â€ added the pallet, who admitted at least a third of him was moderately soggy after being discarded in a puddle. 
â€œUgh, whatâ€™s the point anymore, itâ€™s going to rain so much between now and next Halloween, Iâ€™ll be rotten and unlovable by then,â€ the pallet concluded, full of anguish. 
There is some hope for the pallet, however, as a local hipster restaurant which has just opened in the city needs something to serve its food on that isnâ€™t a plate.
