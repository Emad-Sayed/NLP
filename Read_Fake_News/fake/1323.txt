Giuliani on FBIâ€™s exoneration of Hillary: â€We are supposed to be a country of justiceâ€™ Former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani tell it like it is By Shepard Ambellas - November 7, 2016 ( INTELLIHUB ) â€” Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared on Fox Newsâ€™ Sean Hannity Show Sunday, to talk about how out of place the Director of the FBI James Comeyâ€™s remarks were regarding the Clinton investigation. 
Giuliani said that back in July there was already â€œoverwhelming evidenceâ€ that Hillary Clinton â€œviolated the law.â€â€Now in November we are hearing that she had her maid print out classified material routinely.â€™ 
â€œSo if she was completely reckless back in July, the new revelation makes the situation much worse,â€™ Giuliani told Hannity. 
To top it all off, Giuliani said that Clinton Foundation monies were supporting Chelsea Clinton â€œfor more than a decadeâ€ and that â€œChelseaâ€™s husband, with Chelseaâ€™s help, was going to foundation donors and raising money for his hedge fund.â€ 
This is â€œracketeering,â€ Giuliani said. 
Sean Hannity pointed out during the exchange that the FBI is operating on a dual standard and if anyone else other than Hillary was being investigated they already would have been locked up for destroying subpoenaed information.
