Email This Week in the News 
You wouldnâ€™t know it by watching the news, but there are actually important things going on in the world that have nothing to do with the Presidential election. Today, weâ€™ll talk about some of these non-election-related events on Survival Saturday, like the Dakota access pipeline, Russia, Venezuela, and our dystopian future. 
For election coverage, go on over to my other website, DaisyLuther.com , which is all Hillary, all the time, right up until the election. (My goal there is to cover the stuff that the MSM is trying to sweep under the rug about their darling.) The Dakota Access Pipeline Protesters Are Being Brutally Attacked by Law Enforcement 
Have you been aware of the ongoing protests by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe about a pipeline being forcibly built across their watershed via eminent domain? They have been joined by other tribes to form a coalition of water protectors who say that the pipeline is a violation of a treaty established between the Sioux and the federal government. ( Here are the important things to know about the protest . Trust me, youâ€™ll want to read this.) 
Everyone who was paying attention breathed a sigh of relief when the US Government for once took a stand on behalf of the little guys back in September. 
â€œThe federal government ordered a halt to work on a $3.8 billion four-state oil pipeline in the Upper Midwest on Friday, handing a temporary victory to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other opponents of the projectâ€¦ 
â€¦The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it wouldnâ€™t authorize construction near Lake Oahe, a culturally important location to the tribe, until the agency determines if it needs to reconsider its previous approvals under the National Environmental Policy Act.â€ ( source ) 
Unfortunately, the governmentâ€™s willingness to do the right thing was short-lived. Work has resumed on the pipeline and all hell is breaking loose â€“ but not by who you might think. Protestors have been non-violent, but law enforcement has been absolutely brutal. Theyâ€™ve beaten up on young people, old people, and independent journalists covering the story. Hundreds have been arrested. 
These people are protecting their water sources and their way of life, and they are being brutalized by our own government. The story youâ€™re getting on the mainstream is that the water protectors are standing there and that the police are standing there and that it is a relatively calm affair. 
That couldnâ€™t be further from the truth. The AntiMedia (who would get a major journalism award if real journalists got such awards) has provided truthful coverage, and it is ugly. Every single person who is against government overreach should be supporting the water protectors. Right now, this affects some people up in North Dakota. But what about when someone wants to build something across your land? What about when someone wants to seize your home? What about when Agenda 21 comes to your back yard? 
Hereâ€™s what really happened at the Dakota Access Pipeline protests . Itâ€™s on film. Itâ€™s ugly. You owe it to your fellow human beings to witness this and be outraged. Go here to learn what you can do to help . With all of this â€œprogress,â€ is humanity at risk of becoming obsolete? 
Thousands of jobs each year are being turned over to computers as humans demand higher wages and better benefits for unskilled labor. Weâ€™ve all ended up on the endless loop of talking to customer service robots on the phone or going to a checkout counter and discovering it is push button and digital. 
Is this all part of a greater plan to make the bulk of humanity utterly dependent on the whims of a few? 
I donâ€™t watch a lot of documentaries, but last night my daughter and I watched Obsolete . This film is available for free on Amazon , and it isnâ€™t one of those dry, boring ones that keep you shifting in your seat in order to stay awake. Itâ€™s fascinating from the moment you hit play. When it was over, we sat there in silence for at least a minute, aghast that we could see the whole thing happening around us right now. 
I canâ€™t recommend this highly enough. Everyone should watch it. Let me quote Morpheus (from the Matrix ) for a moment here. â€œThis is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pillâ€”the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pillâ€”you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all Iâ€™m offering is the truth. Nothing more.â€ 
This documentary is the red pill. Take it if you want to survive the future that is coming for us all. 
Watch Obsolete then come back over here and letâ€™s talk about it. I think this will spark a very interesting conversation. How will you prepare for a future in which humanity is largely obsolete? Meanwhile in Venezuelaâ€¦ 
Things are still awful there, although there hasnâ€™t been as much news coverage. Basically, this is how life is now for Venezuelans, and recovering from this collapse could take decades. 
Currently, the people of the country are revolting against the unpopular president, Nicholas Maduro. A campaign had begun for a recall election in order to replace Maduro, but authorities halted the process. The electoral council cited fraud when faced with huge numbers of signatures on a petition. Thousands of demonstrators filled the streets. Source: Federico Parra /AFP/Getty Images 
NPR reports : 
The demonstrators were protesting â€œwhat they call a sharp turn towards authoritarianism. The Maduro government has jailed opposition leaders, stripped Congress of its powers and cracked down on the press.â€ 
As for Maduro, he has blatantly threatened to jail anyone who tries to remove him from power, via elections or legal means, ironically citing the Venezuelan constitution : 
â€œIf they launch a supposed political trial, which is not in our constitution, the state prosecution service must bring legal action in the courts and put in jail anyone who violates the constitution, even if they are members of Congress.â€ 
Whatâ€™s more, in a conversation with the American DEA, Maduroâ€™s nephew says that Venezuela is at war with the US, which is news to most Americans. Efrain Campo was busted doing a quick cocaine deal in order to make money for the Venezuelan First Family. He was caught attempting to smuggle $5 million of Columbian cocaine into the US. The Charlotte Observer reported : 
Efrain Campoâ€¦was recorded saying â€œweâ€™re at warâ€ with the Americans and laughing about sending opposition leaders to jail, according to the transcript, which was filed in federal district court in New York. 
â€œWe need the money,â€ Campo said, according to the transcript. â€œWhy? Because the Americans are hitting us hard with money. Do you understand? The opposition . . . is getting an infusion of a lot of money.â€ 
â€¦The defense has sought to paint Campo and his cousin as victims of a U.S. political plot against the Venezuelan government and has asserted that they didnâ€™t have the knowledge or capability to pull off such a complicated transaction. Weâ€™re irritating the snot out of Russiaâ€¦ 
Lately, the Powers That Shouldnâ€™t Be (great phrase borrowed from my friend Mel at Truthstream Media ) have been going out of their way to paint Russia and Vladimir Putin as the biggest threat to America. A bigger threat, even, than Hillary Clinton, and boy, thatâ€™s a stretch. Iâ€™m pretty sure you can put all of these recent headlines together and get a picture of where this is headed. ( Hint .) There are many more, but I donâ€™t want this post to be a lengthy novel about idiocy.
