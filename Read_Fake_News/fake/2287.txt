Trump â€œYou Canâ€™t Read 650k Emails in 8 days, Hillary is GUILTY!â€ Trump â€œYou Canâ€™t Read 650k Emails in 8 days, Hillary is GUILTY!â€ Breaking News By Amy Moreno November 7, 2016 
Trump weighed in on the CORRUPTION FIASCO created and perpetuated by the FBI. 
Comey, the DISGRACED FBI director, re-opened the email investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€™s CRIMINAL mishandling of classified emails after finding 650K NEW emails on Anthony Weinerâ€™s computer that were â€œdirectly tiedâ€ to Hillaryâ€™s case. 
As Hillary began TANKING in the polls, Comey came out and said, â€œOh, whoops, nothing to see here, Hillaryâ€™s fine, no charges!â€ 
Now, how the hell do you go through 650K emails in 8 days, when previously it took the FBI over a YEAR to go through 53k? 
It doesnâ€™t happen. 
We all know that the RIGGED SYSTEM which Hillary used to STEAL the primary is the SAME RIGGED SYSTEM she uses to keep her out of jail. 
There are countless GOOD people rotting away in prison for doing a TINY FRACTION of what Hillary did. 
How is that fair? 
In addition, we just learned that Hillary Clinton had her MAID printing off classified documents for her. 
Thatâ€™s right, he MAID, for the love of god. 
Also, the FBI says that at least 5 foreign countries hacked her system. 
â€¦and this criminal-harpy is running for president? 
No. Over 80% of Americans believe Hillary is GUILTY. 
SAY NO to this vile crap, AMERICA. 
From Politico: 
Reacting to news that the FBI wonâ€™t change its determination in the Hillary Clinton email probe, Republican nominee Donald Trump made it clear he still regards her as guilty and is convinced she will ultimately face justice. 
â€œYou canâ€™t review 650,000 emails in eight days,â€ Trump said Sunday in an appearance at the Freedom Hill Amphitheater. â€œYou canâ€™t do it folks. Hillary Clinton is guilty.â€
