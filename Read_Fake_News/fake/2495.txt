Pennsylvania has emerged as a key battleground state in the 2016 presidential election â€” the first time a Republican nominee has put the state â€œin playâ€ since 1988. Hillary closed her campaign in the state, and has put in tens of millions in ad spending she never expected to need. 
But on Election Day, dozens of reports of voting machine â€œirregularitiesâ€ are coming in from across the Keystone State â€” every single one from Trump voters. 
Black conservative Aedonis posted this video from his polling place in a Philly suburb, where his machine would not take his Trump vote : this is what I was talking about, they fixed it but it was on some nut shit at first. pic.twitter.com/GO5Y9FCnYN

And to add insult to injury, before â€œ calibrating â€ the machine (why wasnâ€™t it already calibrated before the vote??), Aedonis said the poll worker tried to get him to KEEP the vote for Hillary! 
And in Clinton Township, PA â€“outside of Pittsburgh â€” the same thing was reported there! Multiple Trump voters saying their machines would not let them vote for himâ€¦ 
Top Right News contacted Rep. Metcalfe, and the county registrar to confirm: Not a single Hillary voter has lodged a similar complaint about vote-switching . 
Isnâ€™t it funny how â€œmis-calibration errorsâ€ always seem to benefit the Democrats? 
Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign has provided a â€œhotlineâ€ to report suspected election shennanigans: (844) 332-2016, or website form here . UPDATE: Reddit reports YouTube is CENSORING searches for these videos!â€¦PLEASE SHARE THIS post with everyone you canâ€¦
