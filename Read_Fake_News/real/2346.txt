DoubleLine Capitalâ€™s Jeffrey Gundlach said Donald Trump, if heâ€™s elected president, would help the U.S. economy recover by going further into debt, just as Ronald Reagan fueled growth in the 1980s.

â€œTrump is going to win, and Trump is going to increase the deficit,â€ Gundlach said during a panel discussion Thursday in New York. Reagan â€œdid it by taking three or four decades of stable nonfinancial debt-to-GDP ratio and putting it on a hockey stick higher.â€

Gundlach, 56, isnâ€™t endorsing any candidate, according to Loren Fleckenstein, a DoubleLine analyst. The fund manager, who has been predicting a Trump election victory since February, noted that Trumpâ€™s campaign slogan, â€œMake America Great Again,â€ resembles Reaganâ€™s â€œLetâ€™s Make America Great Again.â€

Under Reagan, the U.S. debt grew to more than $2.3 trillion at the end of 1988 from $807 billion eight years earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The total U.S. debt as of Dec. 31 was $15.1 trillion.

Markets might not react favorably to a Trump election at first, because the Republican presidential candidate has criticized international trade agreements, according to the fund manager.

â€œFirst, I think youâ€™re going to get a global growth scare, trade-based,â€ Gundlach said. â€œThat could cause a market rollover which to me looks like itâ€™s already under way.â€

This retreat in the S&P 500 Index could be â€œan excellent buying opportunity,â€ Gundlach added, as the debt binge â€œwill probably stimulate growth, at least temporarily.â€

The S&P 500 is down about 0.6 percent since Trumpâ€™s victory Tuesday in the Indiana primary. His win prompted his two remaining Republican opponents, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, to suspend their campaigns.

â€œWhen I say Donald Trumpâ€™s going to win, itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m wildly rooting for him, although I donâ€™t dislike Donald Trump,â€ Gundlach said in an interview with Fox Business Networkâ€™s â€œWall Street Weekâ€ set to air Friday at 8 p.m. New York time. â€œItâ€™s just like, I think itâ€™s going to happen.â€

On the panel discussion, Gundlach said oil prices must get to $60 a barrel to avoid a wave of high-yield debt defaults, a price he doesnâ€™t expect to see soon. He predicted more junk-bond defaults when borrowers are forced to roll over debt in a rising interest-rate environment by 2018 or the following two years.

Gundlach said he continues to be long on gold. Spot gold was trading at about $1,277 an ounce as of 6:48 p.m. Thursday in New York, up 20 percent this year. In January, Gundlach said he expected gold would climb to $1,400.
