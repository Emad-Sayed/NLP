That in itself was a sign that the punch landed; normally Oâ€™Reilly doesnâ€™t descend from his perch in the â€œno-spin zoneâ€ to debate mere mortals on platforms besides Fox. The Mother Jones story is embarrassing, but itâ€™s probably not fatal. Most of the â€œreportingâ€ on Fox has roughly the same relationship with the truth as Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s claim to combat zone action. I canâ€™t see him facing censure for this, but I hope Iâ€™m wrong.

If you missed the action, Corn and Daniel Schulman reported that despite Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s claims of having â€œsurvived a combat operationâ€ during the Falklands War, the Fox host, then with CBS, only got as close as Buenos Aires, roughly 1,400 miles away from the fighting. â€œNobody from CBS got to the Falklands,â€ CBSâ€™s Bob Schieffer told Mother Jones. â€œI came close. Weâ€™d been trying to get somebody down there. It was impossible.â€

There was, of course, no combat in the Argentinian capital, but there was a raucous protest, and thatâ€™s apparently what Oâ€™Reilly refers to as a â€œcombat operation.â€ He also claimed he was the only CBS reporter covering the demonstration, which Schieffer likewise denies. â€œWe were all out with our camera crews that day to cover the protest,â€ Schieffer says. â€œIâ€™d been out there with a crew too.â€

Likewise, his claim of having seen combat danger in El Salvador is undermined by reporting â€“ the reporting of Bill Oâ€™Reilly himself, on the ground, in real time. In his book â€œThe No-Spin Zoneâ€ Oâ€™Reilly tells of visiting a dangerous, â€œguerrilla controlled areaâ€ with a camera crew, where â€œI quickly did a stand-up amid the rubble and we got the hell out of there.â€

His real-time dispatch for CBS was different. He described touring a scene by helicopters with the Salvadoran military, and reported â€œthese days Salvadoran soldiers appear to be doing more singing than fighting,â€ having succeeded in â€œscattering the rebel forces, leaving government troops in control of most of the country.â€ There was no mention of having to â€œget the hell out of there.â€ The problem for people who care about the truth is that Oâ€™Reilly is not likely to be punished for shading it. Heâ€™s a serial exaggerator â€“ remember his claim to be the product of middle-class Levittown, when he grew up in tonier Westbury? Much of the â€œreportingâ€ on Fox is similarly distorted; the ratio of truth to fiction is often worse than in Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s combat zone mythology. The made-up Fox bogeymen of the New Black Panther Party were actually less dangerous to democracy than Buenos Aires was to Oâ€™Reilly. More recently, the networkâ€™s claim of Muslim-only â€œno-goâ€ zones in London was based on even skimpier evidence. I personally got a big story wrong last year: I predicted Foxâ€™s Sean Hannity would pay a price for hyping the cause of racist grifter Cliven Bundy, especially after Stephen Colbert flayed him for it. But he didnâ€™t. So while I hope to be wrong this time â€” by underestimating Roger Ailesâ€™s conscience, rather than exaggerating it â€“ I donâ€™t expect to be. The good news is, Iâ€™ve covered a lot of unruly protests in my time. Iâ€™m glad to know I can now claim to have â€œsurvived a combat operation.â€ Thanks, Bill!
