Why you should vote for me.

In January, America is going to have a new president. Things are going to change â€” that much is certain. The question is, what kind of change are we going to have?

We can build an economy that works for everyone, or stack the deck even more for those at the top.

We can keep America safe through strength and smarts â€” or turn our backs on our allies, and cozy up to our adversaries.

We can come together to build a stronger, fairer America, or fear the future and fear each other.

Everything Iâ€™ve done, as first lady, senator, or secretary of State, Iâ€™ve done by listening to people and looking for common ground, even with people who disagree with me. And if you elect me on Tuesday, thatâ€™s the kind of president Iâ€™ll be.

Here are four priorities for my first 100 days â€” issues Iâ€™ve heard about from Americans all over our country.

First, we will put forward the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. Weâ€™ll invest in infrastructure and manufacturing to grow our economy for years to come. Weâ€™ll produce enough renewable energy to power every home in America within a decade. Weâ€™ll cut red tape for small businesses and make it easier for entrepreneurs to get the credit they need to grow and hire â€” because in America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it. Weâ€™ll pay for it all by asking the wealthy, Wall Street and big corporations to finally pay their fair share. And this commitment will go far beyond the first 100 days. Creating more good jobs with rising incomes will be a central mission of my presidency.

Second, we will introduce comprehensive immigration reform legislation. The last president to sign comprehensive immigration reform was Ronald Reagan, and it was a priority for George W. Bush. Iâ€™m confident that we can work across the aisle to pass comprehensive reform that keeps families together and creates a path to citizenship, secures our border, and focuses our enforcement resources on violent criminals. This is the right thing to do, and it will also grow our economy.

Third, to break the gridlock in Washington, we need to get secret, unaccountable money out of our politics. Itâ€™s drowning out the voices of the American people. So within my first 30 days, I will introduce a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. We should be protecting citizensâ€™ rights to vote, not corporationsâ€™ rights to buy elections.

Fourth, we need to get started on end-to-end criminal justice reform. Too many people have been sent away for far too long for non-violent offenses. I believe our country will be stronger and safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law.

Thereâ€™s so much more we need to do together, and we certainly wonâ€™t get it all done in the first 100 days. But weâ€™re going to roll up our sleeves and get to work for American families â€” and Iâ€™ll never, ever quit.

I want to be president for all Americans â€” Democrats, Republicans and independents; Americans of every race, faith and background.

My opponent has run his campaign on divisiveness, fear and insults, and spent months pitting Americans against each other. Iâ€™ve said many times that Donald Trump has shown us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are.

Because itâ€™s not just our names on the ballot this year. Every issue we care about is on the ballot, too. This is about who we are as a country â€” and whether we are going to have change that makes us stronger together, or change that pushes us further apart.

It all comes down to this. I love our country. I believe in our people. And I think thereâ€™s nothing we canâ€™t achieve if we work together and invest in each other.

Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee for president.
