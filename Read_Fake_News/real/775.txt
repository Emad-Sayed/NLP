SYRIA CASTS SHADOWS ON 2016 DEMS - As Vice President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton crisscross the nation and the globe raising their public profiles (and padding their donor lists) ahead of potential 2016 presidential bids, the Obama administrationâ€™s stumbles on Syria are posing serious problems. The Democratic base is in an uproar over the proposed strikes, but neither Biden nor Clinton can politely distance themselves from the presidentâ€™s policies. They own them. But they can begin a long, slow march away from their president.

Biden could face grilling at steak fry - Vice President Joe Biden heads to Iowa Sunday for Democratic Sen. Tom Harkinâ€™s annual steak fry. The Des Moines Register reports that President Obamaâ€™s friction with Harkin and other liberal lawmakers about Obamaâ€™s now-shelved request for congressional backing for strikes against Syria could complicate what is usually a casting call for presidential contenders in the home state for the first-in-the-nation nominating caucus.

Job chat in South Carolina - The White House announced Vice President Joe Biden will discuss jobs and infrastructure at the Port of Charleston in South Carolina Monday. South Carolina traditionally hosts the second presidential primary.

At least he warned us! - Vice President Joe Biden called House Republicans â€œNeanderthalsâ€ for resisting Democratsâ€™ ultimately successful effort this year to add men in same-sex couples to the Violence against Women Act. Biden, speaking at a celebration of the actâ€™s 19th anniversary at his official residence, prefaced his â€œNeanderthalâ€ claim thusly: â€œI'm going to say something outrageous.â€ He also touted his legislative expertise: â€œI think I understand the Senate better than any man or women whoâ€™s ever served in there.â€

WILL HILLARY ADDRESS SYRIA ON WORLD STAGE? - Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is in Scotland today to speak to the graduating class at St. Andrewâ€™s University. With Britain already backed out of a U.S. coalition for Syria strikes and strong public sentiment there against joining the conflict, what will Americaâ€™s former top diplomat say? In speeches earlier this week, Clinton voiced general support for President Obamaâ€™s Syria policy, but steered clear of his call for airstrikes, preferring to speak of â€œa strong responseâ€ led by the U.N.

Kerry crunch - With her successor stranded in Geneva trying to win weapons talks with his Russian counterpart, a little help from Clinton would surely be appreciated. But will Clinton be willing to sidle up to the unpopular war plan?

Huma rushes back to Hillary - Following her husband Anthony Weinerâ€™s crushing defeat in the New York mayoral election on Tuesday, Huma Abedin, the longtime right-hand woman to Hillary Clinton, is back. Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines, told TPM on Thursday that Abedin has returned to her position as director of the former secretary of Stateâ€™s team.

Hillary staffs up - The departure of President Obamaâ€™s top economic adviser, Gene Sperling, first reported by Fox Business, provides some more manpower for Hillary Clintonâ€™s policy team.  From the NYT: â€œIf Hillary Rodham Clinton runs for president in 2016, Mr. Sperling, 54, is expected to join her team, a quarter-century after he played a prominent role in her husbandâ€™s first presidential campaign.â€ Sperling will be replaced by Obamaâ€™s former budget boss, Jeffrey Zients.

Corruption probe touches Hillary - WaPo reports federal investigators are probing a senior campaign adviser to Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2008 campaign, Minyon Moore, as they seek to build a case against D.C. businessman Jeffrey Thompson for his role in launching a shadow campaign to elect D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray.

Trickles down to Virginia governor race - WaPo also reports Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, the longtime top fundraiser for the Clintons, will not return a donation to his 2009 governor campaign from Thompson.

[WSJâ€™s Kimberly Strassel: â€œThese questions stretch beyond shady money funneling to Gray and Clinton campaigns. Mr. Thompson had reason to have friends in high places, since his accounting firm served as a significant government contractor.â€]

With your second cup of coffee... Liberal pundit Peter Beinart looks at the generation gap that could trap Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2016 campaign for the Daily Beast in The Rise of the New New Left : â€œIf the Millennials challenge Reaganite orthodoxy, they will likely challenge Clintonian orthodoxy, too.â€

KERRY SAYS ATTACKS STILL POSSIBLE - After the first day of weapons talks, Secretary of State John Kerry maintained that the U.S. is still poised for a unilateral military strike against Syria, despite a political impasse in Washington and President Obamaâ€™s tabling of his request for congressional approval. Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov continue their discussions today in Geneva over a Russian offer to help secure Syriaâ€™s chemical weapons.

Not a game - â€œExpectations are high. They are high for the United States, perhaps even more so for Russia to deliver on the promise of this moment. This is not a game, and I said that to my friend Sergey when we talked about it initially.â€ â€“ Secretary of State John Kerry at a press briefing.

Obama to reprise Syria stance - President Obama will sit down with ABCâ€™s George Stephanopoulos for Sundayâ€™s installment of â€œThis Week.â€

Dr. K weighs in â€“ From Charles Krauthammerâ€™s syndicated column, The fruits of epic incompetence: â€œAssad, far from receiving punishment of any kind, goes from monster to peace partner. Putin bestrides the world stage, playing dealmaker. Heâ€™s welcomed by America as a constructive partner. Now a world statesman, he takes to the New York Times to blame American interventionist arrogance â€” a.k.a. â€American exceptionalismâ€™â€¦â€

Some donuts, though, ARE exceptional - Krispy Kreme opened its first store in Moscow on Thursday. WaPo reports nearly 200 people eagerly waited for the store to flip on the famous â€œhot nowâ€ sign.

CONGRESS NOT WAITING ON OBAMA - Campaign Carl Cameron - â€œCould the rare, bipartisan emergency meeting of the nationâ€™s top four congressional leaders Thursday signal that Hill leaders have given up hope of real help from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue on solving looming fiscal crises?

Congress has learned to expect little from President Obama where budget matters are concerned. And the president's zig-zagging struggle for a coherent Syria policy has led many to conclude that the president is no longer becoming a lame duck. He is one.

House Speaker John Boehner, along with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, sat down with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to discuss the possibility of a government shutdown at the end of this month, raising the $16 trillion federal debt limit debt in the next five weeks and dealing with the next round of â€sequestrationâ€™ spending caps.

Democrats and Republicans are light years apart on how best to deal with these fiscal issues.  Most will be handled with a series of delaying tactics that will keep the government operating but ignore the hard choices needed for lasting solutions.

Those fights will be fierce and could take the government to the brink, or over it. But the one politician in the mix who no longer worries about future elections is, of course, President Obama. On the Hill, friends and foes alike are already seeing signs that he is now thinking and acting that way.â€ â€“ Carl Cameron

Boehner in a bind - Conservativemembers of House Speaker John Boehner's caucus are demanding a vote on a measure to defund ObamaCare as part of ongoing budget talks. Conservative lawmakers rejected a compromise plan from leadership earlier this week. Boehner told reporters: â€œI'm well aware of the deadlinesâ€¦ I think there's a way to get thereâ€¦ There are a million options that are being discussed by a lot of people.â€

Baier Tracks: Donâ€™t blame the messengerâ€¦ â€œAs the Obama administration is having horrible problems trying to contain the Syria crisis, House Speaker John Boehner appears to be having real problems controlling his Republican caucus.

Some Republicans say itâ€™s being trumped up by the media with headlines like this in the NYT: â€œBoehner Seeking Democratsâ€™ Help on Fiscal Talks.â€

The problem: It is all true. This could be a bumpy road to Sept. 30 and a continuing resolution to fund the government, and an even bumpier ride to raise the debt ceiling by mid-October.â€ â€“ Bret Baier

The last time there was a shutdown - Glen Bolger of top GOP polling firm Public Opinion Strategies reviews how the public blamed Republicans for the 1995 -1996 government shutdowns and how the partyâ€™s standing quickly diminished. Then-President Bill Clintonâ€™s approval level bounced to 60 percent while a plurality (48 percent) of respondents blamed Republicans for the shutdown. The same share of voters approved of how Clinton handled the budget negotiations, with only 22 percent approving of then-House Speaker Newt Gingrichâ€™s approach.

[â€œThe anarchists are winning...â€ --Senate Majority leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. in a press briefing Thursday ,following a meeting with top congressional leaders to discuss avoiding a government shutdown]

OBAMA, BIDEN TRY TO SOOTHE UNION OBAMACARE ANXIETY - President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will meet with labor leaders at the White House this afternoon after the nationâ€™s largest union, the AFL-CIO, issued a scathing resolution against ObamaCare. Republicans, meanwhile, are trying to head off an expected carve-out for unions getting socked by new ObamaCare regulations.

His passenger clown, 77-year-old Norman Clouser of York, was unhurt. Police said â€Dimplesâ€™ was wearing clown shoes but the oversized footwear apparently didn't play a role in the crash.â€

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLESâ€¦â€œA month ago, [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad] was a war criminal and [Russian President Vladimir Putin] was a pariah for covering in the U.N. on the poison gas attack. And because of how flummoxed our president is, Putin is now a statesman, a partner in peace, and he's in a position where he can lecture the United States of America.â€  â€“ Charles Krauthammer on â€œSpecial Report with Bret Baierâ€ Watch here.
