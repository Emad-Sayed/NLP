In a Monday column for the far-right website World Net Daily, the longtime anti-feminist crusader lamented the declining portion of university enrollments accounted for by men. Schlafly â€” BA and JD, Washington University in St. Louis; MA, Radcliffe College â€” argued that it may even be time to implement quotas to ensure that men constitute at least half of a collegeâ€™s enrollment.

â€œLong ago when I went to college, campuses were about 70 percent male, and until 1970 it was still nearly 60 percent,â€ Schlafly wrote. â€œToday, however, the male percentage has fallen to the low 40s on most campuses.â€

Never one to shirk victim-blaming, Schlafly proceeded to link the problem of campus sexual assault to the increased enrollment of women in postsecondary institutions.

â€œBoys are more likely than girls to look at the cost-benefit tradeoff of going to college,â€ Schlafly asserted. â€œThe imbalance of far more women than men at colleges has been a factor in the various sex scandals that have made news in the last couple of years.â€

With so many women around, what do you expect a college man to do â€” seek consent!? â€œSo, whatâ€™s the solution?â€ Schlafly asked. â€œOne solution might be to impose the duty on admissions officers to arbitrarily admit only half women and half men.â€ â€œAnother solution might be to stop granting college loans,â€ she suggested, â€œthereby forcing students to take jobs to pay for their tuition and eliminate time for parties, perhaps even wiping out time for fraternities and sororities. I went through college while working a full-time manual-labor job, and I donâ€™t regret a minute of it; it was a great learning experience.â€ While minimum wage jobs once sufficed to pay oneâ€™s way through college, skyrocketing tuition has created a harsher reality for college students. Absent financial aid and family assistance, the typical college student would now need to work 48 hours a week at a minimum wage job in order to pay for her courses â€” and thatâ€™s before accounting for the ever-increasing cost of room and board.
