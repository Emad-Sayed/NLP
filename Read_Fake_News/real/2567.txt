The official candidates â€” Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz â€” gathered at Nashua, New Hampshireâ€™s Crowne Plaza hotel this Friday and Saturday for the First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit. The summit also featured unofficial candidates who are almost certainly running but canâ€™t quite say so yet for legal/fundraising reasons: Scott Walker, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Bobby Jindal, Rick Perry, Carly Fiorina, and Mike Huckabee, to name a few. You also had your for-pretend candidates, like Donald Trump and Lindsey Graham. Beneath them are the YOLO candidates, like former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, former New York Gov. George Pataki, and former U.N. ambassador John Bolton. All here. Former Maryland Gov. Bob Ehrlich occupies whatever tier is beneath Gilmore and Pataki, and he was here, too. At the very bottom of the pile is this guy. Here.

New Hampshire Republicans are not the same as Iowa Republicans. Theyâ€™re blunt and talk fast and are in no way intimidated to ask a governor or senator or ambassador whateverâ€™s on their mind, in a shrewd, distrusting whatâ€™s your angle here? sort of way. Thereâ€™s a libertarian bent to the stateâ€™s conservative politics and, by and large, no one wants to waste any precious time talking about, say, gay marriage.

This is not to say that the conservative die-hards in New Hampshire donâ€™t have their own quirks. The ones in attendance at the FITN summit, at least, care a lot about ISIS establishing beachheads on the continent and the scourge of â€œillegals.â€ If you were wondering last fall why New Hampshire GOP Senate candidate Scott Brown kept going on about ISIS fighters crossing the southern border to infect Americans with Ebola, a few conversations at the Crowne Plaza in Nashua would make it quite clear. Thereâ€™s a paranoid style to New Hampshire politics.

â€œHeâ€™s trying to destroy the country,â€ a woman in black-and-white shoes and a Diane Keaton-style tie/vest combination, whispered to me during the speech from former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. She was referring to the current Democratic president â€” or â€œDemocrat president,â€ in the parlance of right-wing conferences. Bolton had just said that the â€œprinciple responsibility of the President of the United States is to protect the country,â€ and for this woman, and presumably everyone else in the room, Barack Obama has performed poorly on that score.

Bizarrely enough, Iâ€™m more familiar with Boltonâ€™s talking points than any other candidateâ€™s, and the man presents a terrifying view of the world. Everyone is trying to bomb us and our president wonâ€™t bomb them, and Bolton canâ€™t stand this, and heâ€™s going to make America care about his particular brand of foreign policy and not all these wishy-washy foofoo issues like education or health care. ISIS is coming for us, Russia is coming for us, China, you name it. And oh, this Iran deal? â€œThe most serious act of appeasement in American history.â€ Bolton likes to close with a dose of levity, about how he has a special understanding of Hillary Clinton since he was a year apart from Bill and Hillary at Yale Law School. Hillary was a â€œradicalâ€ then, and sheâ€™s a radical now. According to Bolton, the way people are in graduate school is pretty much the way they are the rest of their lives, and Hillary Clinton is every bit the leftist that Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama are. Scared yet?

â€œI read an article in the Investorâ€™s Business Daily that scared the crap out of me,â€ an older man began his question to Bolton. Turns out ISIS is setting up training camps in New Mexico, or maybe itâ€™s Mexico-Mexico, and theyâ€™re pouring across the border. (The article in question cites a report from Judicial Watch, a right-wing paranoiac crank website, saying ISIS has â€œspottersâ€ in New Mexico to aid in deadly terrorist crossings.) This news didnâ€™t surprise John Bolton at all. John Bolton is never surprised. John Bolton has seen some things.

â€œIâ€™ve been reading some things about ISIL,â€ another older man says. Heâ€™s been reading the Internet and you just wonâ€™t believe the stuff heâ€™s finding. ISIS is trying to establish a Caliphate and, according to the Koran, once the Caliphate is established, all Muslims are required to pledge allegiance to it and kill all non-participants. Why arenâ€™t we stopping Islam? John Bolton is of course aware of this, and not surprised by it, and to him the fact that Barack Obama wonâ€™t even name the enemy gives the enemy enormous power.

But these two questioners were warm-up acts for the Greatest Question Ever. It came from the woman sitting next to me, the same one who had whispered to me earlier that Obama is â€œtrying to destroy the country.â€ She didnâ€™t mean this metaphorically. She had evidence â€” proof so ironclad that it could only have come from a weird multicolor-font chain email that old people forward to each other.

â€œWhat do you think about the War on Terror within?â€ She asks? Obama has been â€œfilling the government with Muslims. He is filling the State Department with the Muslim Brotherhood.â€ It gets worse. This woman has also heard that Barack Obama is â€œamassing tanks and artillery weaponsâ€ to stage a revolution â€œin the streets.â€ He may have several four- and five-star generals who are going along with this. And then thereâ€™s theâ€“

â€œThe answer is no,â€ John Bolton cut her off, laughing nervously. She had managed to surprise John Bolton, and thatâ€™s an accomplishment.

â€œWell, youâ€™re probably nicer to me than the conservative media,â€ Mike Huckabee told me, after I was introduced to him as a reporter from a liberal news outlet.

I had been watching him on Fox News from the hotel lounge, announcing that he announce his presidential decision in early May. Right after the segment aired, Mike Huckabee walked through the lounge on his way to something else. Like a moron, I pointed at the TV and said to him â€œYOU WERE JUST ON THE TV,â€ as though bewildered that someone can climb out of a television set and into real life.

Canâ€™t say Iâ€™ve ever been very nice to Mike Huckabee, but itâ€™s true that heâ€™s about to go to war with conservative media. Small-government fiscal conservatives have never liked Huckabee. For all outspoken social conservatism and a foreign policy informed by fundamentalist interpretation of Revelation, heâ€™s never been much of a budget-cutter. (Heâ€™ll claim that a lot of this had to do with the Democratic legislature he dealt with when he was governor of Arkansas.) And in the past few days, heâ€™s been the (unofficial) presidential candidate coming out hardest against Chris Christieâ€™s plan to cut Social Security.

Heâ€™s not framing it in liberal terms â€” about how means-testing Social Security would welfarize the program and erode its support â€” and he looked sort of confused when I tried to explain that argument. But Huckabee has a problem, as a vast majority of those affected almost certainly will, with people paying into Social Security for decades and then not getting back whatâ€™s owed them, whether those cuts come in the form of means-testing, a raise in the retirement age, or linking cost-of-living increases to chained CPI. And since heâ€™s a professional politician who understands his audience, heâ€™s spinning it another way: the government is stealing the money of the people. You lent the government your money, and theyâ€™re not letting you have it back. Itâ€™s Big Government Theft. Thatâ€™ll do.

Huckabee is good with people. So is Chris Christie, in his own, unorthodox style. Itâ€™s an attribute he must have great strength in, since heâ€™s preparing a campaign centered on yelling at people about cutting Social Security and Medicare. Christie came to the summit to continue selling his plan. Sharp cuts to social insurance programs are an extension of the overall Christie message of tough love, or a belief that in Americaâ€™s heart of heart lurks a masochist. Christie said he is starting his run (Unofficially! Per the lawyers! ) with a 12-point proposal on cutting entitlement spending because he wants to run a campaign based on â€œstrength, clarity, and hard truths.â€ â€œLeadershipâ€ is the other word Christie loves to employ. To Christie, â€œleadershipâ€ means the willingness to put forth these â€œhard truths,â€ like how Social Security needs a good whooping. Itâ€™s a testament to his skills that heâ€™s even trying something like this. But in order for it to be successful heâ€™ll need to convince people that what heâ€™s saying, and the policies heâ€™s pushing, are the only possible correct ones. That heâ€™s telling the truth, and anyone who disagrees with him is a liar, and his plan is literally the only way to shore up Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid for the long haul. If anyone can do this, itâ€™s Christie. But itâ€™s far from a sure thing that anyone can do this. Another plank of Christieâ€™s big plan is to reform Social Security disability benefits. There are too many working-age people out there falsely claiming disability and we need to get them back in the workforce. Grr! During his Q&A segment, a woman took issue with this part of the plan. She told him that she has a 24-year-old son with Aspergerâ€™s syndrome and he canâ€™t keep a job, so he really needs disability benefits. Christie assures her that her sonâ€™s case is legitimate and he has no intention of harming him The woman, having secured a pledge from Christie to protect her sonâ€™s bennies, then asked Christie what heâ€™s going to do about all the illegals immigrants coming to take our jobs. Near the end of his answer Christie acknowledged, in another one of his hard truths, that the 11 or 12 million undocumented immigrants in the country cannot be relied upon to all â€œself-deport.â€ (Poor Mitt Romney.) Was this the part where humanityâ€™s truthiest truth-teller was going to go all-in for amnesty? Not quite. He merely suggested that leaders of both parties are going to have to come together to find a solution for that. The reason it hasnâ€™t happened already, according to Christie, is that thereâ€™s been â€œno leadership from the White House.â€ You might think that pushing with its political might a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill would count as some kind of leadership on this issue, but apparently not. Thatâ€™s just another hard truth from Chris Christie. Independent Journal Review is a conservative viral news, politics and culture site that gets something like ten trillion visitors a day. Isnâ€™t that neat? The outlet was a sponsor of the summit and held party at a nearby restaurant, in collaboration with Facebook. It was open bar and complemented by a sensational spread of fancy cheeses and little steak nibbly things (I am not a food writer) and fresh, raw oysters on the half shell. Free swag all over the place. Internet money is the best money. I walked out of the bathroom and there was Marco Rubio sitting at a big table all to himself, on a laptop, as though cramming a college paper about British Romanticism. He was fielding questions on Facebook. Rubio, 43, is considered the youthful, hip candidate in the field, the â€™90s rap fan who really gets millennial culture. Heâ€™s all about these edgy, disruptive new technologies that allow politicians to respond to questions people submit on a website. â€œFacebook has gotten older, but Instagram has gotten younger,â€ Rubio said to an Instagram representative after the Q&A. He quickly corrected himself. â€œI mean, Twitter has gotten older, but Instagram has gotten younger.â€ Exactly. After Rubio, it was time for millennialsâ€™ real presidential standard-bearer, John Bolton, to do his Facebook Q&A. Scott Brown was also at this party for some reason. Ted Cruz shows no intention of dropping anytime soon his joke about how he would shut down the IRS and put all of its employees on the southern border, though now he includes a disclaimer to â€œthe mediaâ€ that heâ€™s being tongue-in-cheek. Eliminating the IRS is part of his tax reform plan, which is to institute a flat tax where returns can be filed on a standard-sized postcard. (Which agency collects and enforces the flat tax postcards in our post-IRS utopia? Details, details, blah blah blah. Weâ€™re no fun, in the media.) Cruz would also â€œrepeal every wordâ€ of Obamacare and â€œrepeal every wordâ€ of Common Core. He makes it easy to remember, at least. You can fit Ted Cruzâ€™s policy platform on a standard-size postcard. Cruz, the final speaker of the event on Saturday, was only able to take a couple of questions. The Crowne Plaza, in an aggressive pursuit of billings, booked the ballroom where the conference was taking place for a wedding reception at 5:00. Cruz finished speaking at 4:00. The tight booking made for some interesting scenes as conference hangers-on mingled with the newlyweds in their formalwear. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker was speaking at a small dinner event for select guests at the other end of the hotel, but he took a respite from the dinner to congratulate the bridge and groom outside the bathroom. A few hours later, I walked out of my hotel with a few other reporters, and there was Ted Cruz getting out of his car. He looked exhausted, so naturally we harassed him with more questions. I asked him about Chris Christieâ€™s Social Security plan and its many, many hard truths. He wouldnâ€™t endorse the plan itself, of course, but he did lay out his broad outlines for Social Security reform. He supports gradually increasing the retirement age, and â€œhaving Social Security benefits grow to match inflation, rather than having growth exceed inflation.â€ (This is the idea behind linking cost-of-living increases to the slower-growing â€œchained CPIâ€ measure of inflation.) Just as the questions wrapped up, with Cruzâ€™s aides tugging on him to walk away from reporters and get inside the sanctuary of his hotel room â€” you get the sense that this is a common occurrence â€” Cruz turned back and said to me that he hasnâ€™t given up on winning me over. (More tugging from the aides.) It turns out that Sen. Ted Cruz is familiar with Salonâ€™s coverage of Ted Cruz, which is largely negative. Though he didnâ€™t say so explicitly, Ted Cruz clearly understands that his fate in the New Hampshire GOP primary rests on his ability to woo Salon. The sooner they all realize this, the better. We take this gatekeeper role seriously and look forward to further engagement with him and our 18 other candidate-friends from the weekend. Good luck to all.
