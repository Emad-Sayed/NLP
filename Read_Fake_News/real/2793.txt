Martin Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s presidential campaign-in-waiting has sought to maintain some suspense about a â€œspecial announcementâ€ he has planned for May 30 in Baltimore.

An email sent out Thursday by Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s team asked â€œIs he in or is he out? Will he run or wonâ€™t he?,â€ and promised people who put their names on an e-mail list that they could be the first to know -- â€œbefore the media, the politicians and the Washington establishment.â€

Not to burst anyoneâ€™s bubble, but the answer is already pretty clear. Here are 10 signs that O'Malley is running:

1) During one of a series of conference calls Thursday night, Oâ€™Malley directed former staffers to a Web site -- www.omalleyannouncement.com -- where people can sign up to attend his May 30 announcement in Baltimore. A line at the bottom of the page says the site is "Paid for by Oâ€™Malley for President.â€

2) Oâ€™Malley aides put out word that he has leased 7,200 square feet of office space -- the right size to lunch an insurgent campaign -- in Baltimore near Penn Station, the cityâ€™s rail hub. Promoting a Baltimore Sun story about the move on Twitter, Oâ€™Malley communications maven Lis Smith, currently a New York resident, wrote, â€œBaltimore, here we come.â€

3) Several aides now employed by Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s political action committee have been looking for places to live in Baltimore.

4) In another conference call Thursday night, Oâ€™Malley aides outlined plans to begin fundraising for a federal committee, i.e. one that could be used to pay for a presidential bid. O'Malley has been using a political action committee to fund his activities, which will no longer be legal once he is officially a candidate.

5) During the call, aides advertised a working lunch on May 21 where supporters can help Oâ€™Malley dial for dollars. They emphasized the need to make a good financial showing before a June 30 reporting deadline.

6) Supporters on the conference call were told of two key members of Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s financial team: Terry Lierman, a former Maryland Democratic Party chairman, as treasurer; and Martin Knott, a Baltimore-area businessman, as finance chairman.

7) Oâ€™Malley has further expanded his press staff in recent days. A tweet sent out by Smith earlier this week announcing the latest two hires -- both females -- referred to Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s â€œ#ladyboss press team.â€

8) Last week, Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s PAC announced the addition of its latest high-profile member: national political director Karine Jean-Pierre.

9) Oâ€™Malley, joined by Jean-Pierre and other aides, made a daylong swing Wednesday through New Hampshire, the nationâ€™s first presidential primary state.

10) Oâ€™Malley's entourage that day included media consultant Jimmy Siegel and a camera crew. Siegel, who worked for Hillary Rodham Clinton during the 2008 presidential cycle, specializes in campaign-style videos.

Of course, there's always the possibility that all of this could be for naught. As longtime Oâ€™Malley watchers may recall, in 2002, when he was mayor of Baltimore, Oâ€™Malley held a press conference to announce he would NOT run for governor that year, avoiding a primary fight with well-known Democrat Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.

As one longtime Oâ€™Malley associate put it Thursday, however, â€œthereâ€™s a different vibe this time.â€ Look for an email from Oâ€™Malley for confirmation.
