Now 68, Bacevich is a West Point graduate who served a tour in Vietnam before taking a doctorate in diplomatic history at Princeton. He subsequently taught international relations at West Point and Johns Hopkins before joining the IR faculty at Boston University in 1998. Bacevich is now emeritus and devotes his time to getting the books out.

I met â€œthe dissident colonel,â€ as he is known in my household, when he spoke at the Providence Council on Foreign Affairs this spring. He spent the evening outlining the book now in his desk, which rests on 10 Theses, as he calls them, after the 95 Theses Martin Luther nailed to a church door (supposedly) in Wittenberg in 1517. They are a detailed critique of what Bacevich considers our 35-year War for the Greater Middle East. He dates this to 1980, when President Carter declared the Persian Gulf a strategic interest warranting military defense. With the Carter Doctine, Bacevich said that evening in Providence, â€œCarter lit a fuse without knowing where it led.â€

â€œLearning offers a first step toward devising wiser, more effective, and less costly policies,â€ Bacevich also said on that occasion. I subsequently traveled to Boston to record this exchange. I found him as I had expected: a conservative man in various respects, a scholar with a disciplined mind ungiven to barricades and placards but vigorously opposed to the direction of American policy abroad and well aware of its roots in our consciousness of exceptionalism.

Youâ€™re a critic of American conduct abroad on numerous grounds â€” I would say a critic with a very particular perspective, and I hope we can explore that. For now, a point of confusion, at least for me: In â€œAmerican Empire,â€ the 2002 book, you note that American policy, or statecraft, as you call it, lost its coherence in the post-Berlin Wall period. Policy before 1989, you thought, was more or less, as you say, mainly realistic. When we met [at the Providence CFR], on the other hand, you traced a certain grandiose streak in U.S. policy to Carterâ€™s 1980 doctrine, which got us into what youâ€™re now calling the War for the Greater Middle East, a 35-year escapade at this point. Can you clarify your thinking on this? When, in your view, did the policy elite lose its way?

To clarify a little bit, until roughly 1990 the hierarchy of interests that shaped U.S. foreign policy privileged Europe and East Asia. Those were the two most important theaters in U.S. foreign policy. And notwithstanding horrific mistakes made along the way, Vietnam being the most important but by no means the only one, if you look at the period from the late 1940s to the 1990s, in the main U.S. policy in these two pivotal regions qualifies as realistic. There was a certain cohesion to U.S. policy. Indeed, one could say there was a strategy. If you wanted to reduce that strategy to a single word, the word would be â€œcontainment.â€ At least until 1980, the Middle Eastâ€”I prefer the term the Greater Middle Eastâ€”tended to be viewed as peripheral in the hierarchy. My argument is that this began to change in 1980, when Jimmy Carter, in response to the hostage crisis in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, promulgated the Carter Doctrine.

Now, it didnâ€™t overnight vault the Greater Middle East to the top rank of U.S. foreign policy interests, but it began that process. And indeed, the end of the Cold War, which tended at least marginally to diminish the importance attributed to Europe and East Asia, facilitated that. So by the time you get to the 1990s, and certainly by the time you get to 9/11, thereâ€™s been this substantial change, and the change gets expressed above all and most regrettably in the reorientation of the U.S. military. Militarily, the United States doesnâ€™t abandon Europe, and it certainly hasnâ€™t abandoned East Asia, but if you look at where weâ€™ve sent U.S. forces to fight or to occupy, especially since 1990, itâ€™s clear that the focal point now is the Greater Middle East. And, to further the contrast, unlike the period of the Cold War, when you can make an argument that there was a certain cohesion in U.S. policy, thereâ€™s been virtually none with regard to the Greater Middle East. What we have is almost a pattern of random military interventionism justified by all kinds of reasons, few of which have produced anything like a positive outcome, and which cumulatively contributed to the destabilization of the Greater Middle East.

I couldnâ€™t agree with you more on that latter point. An American imperium bent on incessant expansion and more or less global dominance is among your bedrock descriptions for what we now live with. Two of the biggest questions on any paying-attention Americanâ€™s mind are just how dangerous this is and whether there is any plausible prospect of change: a new American ambition, purpose or however you want to put it. What are your views in each case? The danger of it and the plausibility of change.

In the danger of pursuing the imperium?

Yes. You have a lot of non-Americans saying the American foreign policy is the single most disorder-creating factor in global affairs today, right?

Well, the preliminary point is to understand where this urge to create a global imperium came from. And several facts contributed. One of which is the long-standing, deeply embedded claim of American exceptionalism, which assigns to us a responsibility to transform the global order in our own image. That goes back to the founding of Anglo-America, the City upon a Hill.

Winthropâ€™s sermon in 1630, to be exact, yes.

Right. But the end of the Cold War and the nearly simultaneous military event we call Operation Desert Storm gave the first twist to that long-standing expectation of what we are called upon to do. The end of the Cold War persuaded American elites in both parties, people on the left and people on the right, that liberal democratic capitalism was destined to triumph everywhere, that the last ideological challenger had been vanquished.

The â€œend of historyâ€ is set.

The end of history is set. So that seemed to bring the vision of global hegemony that much closer. Desert Storm seems to demonstrateâ€”this is not so inaccurate, misleadingâ€”that the United States is in possession of military powers such that the world has never seen. We believe by 1991 that we have not only vanquished the last standing ideological opponent, but that we have achieved a military supremacy.

Now you combine that sort of generalized mission to save the world with the end of history and with the belief that we now possess the means to exercise dominance, and you have a very explosive combination that, by the 1990s, makes global hegemony seem possible. Of course, the 1990s is not the decade of the evil neoconservative and the bad Republicans. Itâ€™s the decade of Bill Clinton, of the liberal Democrats calling the shots. But if you look at what happens in the 1990s, you find this expansive rhetoric. They donâ€™t use the term â€œempire,â€ but it is an imperialistic rhetoric, and you also find, under Clinton, a growing willingness to put that American military power to use. To do what Clinton would argue would be good things in the world. And that takes the form of a far greater willingness to intervene. In Somalia, in Haiti, in Kosovo, in Bosnia, with the expectation that somehow this interventionism is going to produce stability, spread our values, help to bring into existence this new American-dominated order. Problem is, of course, that the results are considerably different. Instead of creating stability we create instability, and, of course, the chickens come home to roost on 9/11, with the attacks on Washington and New York.

Weâ€™ll come back to this question of exceptionalism in a minute.

Youâ€™ve been proven right times 10 in arguing a long time ago that the thought of post-Cold War disarray in American policy circlesâ€”no aim, no strategyâ€”is wrong. The aim from the first Bush and Clinton onward has been to cast the world in the American image, just as you said: open markets, a sort of extreme capitalism. That leads straight to the problem of exceptionalism, as youâ€™ve just suggested. I take it you agree. Now, hereâ€™s the question: If the problem is the consciousness of exceptionalism, the matter of change becomes more daunting. Youâ€™re not talking about changing a law, youâ€™re not yet talking about changing how many divisions we ought to have in Guam. Youâ€™re talking about changing a kind of national consciousness.

So, returning to the previous question, how realistic is this? You mentioned in Providence, â€œWe must learn the lessons.â€ Itâ€™s a good phrase: Of course we must learn the lessons. But, time and again I have to say to myself: I donâ€™t see any evidence of learning in Washington. Theyâ€™re allergic to the past. They canâ€™t stand history. Weâ€™re a nation of forgetters. How realistic is it to expect them to learn anything? And if we donâ€™t learn anything, weâ€™re in a very bad track.

Well, and I am certainly not optimistic about our willingness to learn. Youâ€™re right, itâ€™s easy to say learn the lessons, but you donâ€™t learn the lessons unless thereâ€™s evidence of some kind of willingness.

So whatâ€™s your thought on that? How can we expect toâ€”

My thought is hope lies, however faint the hope may be, in the possibility of introducingâ€”reintroducingâ€”into the debate over foreign policy a sense of realism. One of the great obstacles to rethinking U.S. foreign policy is the extent to which both of the major parties buy into, I think for mostly cynical reasons, the premises of American exceptionalism. So here we are, you and I are speaking. Weâ€™re in sort of the preliminary stages of the 2016 presidential campaigns, and it is not difficult to predict that from both sides we will hear calls for American leadership. The insistence that there is no alternative to American leadership, the promises of sustaining American strengthâ€”

Correct. And so, the best one can hope for is somehowâ€”not that a critic of foreign policy is going to win a nomination; theyâ€™re notâ€”but somehow, someone capable of critical thinking with regard to foreign policy could at least make it far enough into the primaries to introduceâ€”

Yes, someone you figure like Webb or something? [Jim Webb is a former Marine, secretary of the Navy and senator from Virginia sometimes mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate in 2016.]

Bingo. So my hope: I would love to see Webb declareâ€”thereâ€™s not a chance that he will get the nomination.

No, but he could influence the conversation.

To have Webb up on the stage with Hillary Clinton and the two or three other figures that may make a run for the Democratic nomination, and forcing a discussion on, for example, the consequences and cost of the Iraq war, would be a helpful thing. There was a time when I would have said the same thing about Rand Paul on the Republican side, but in the present moment Iâ€™m not so sure. My current sense is that he is so eager to win the nomination that he is willing to compromise on his non-interventionist principles.

And if he does, that will be a lost opportunity. In a sense, who ends up being president is, at this stage of the game, of less interest than whether or not the process of presidential campaigning can bear some fruit in terms of opening up a serious discussion of exactly where we are, and how we got here with regard to foreign policy.

Itâ€™ll come over as a very sour view. Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s mine, but itâ€™s becoming mine and thereâ€™s optimism at the far end of it: I often think weâ€™re just going to have to get one bloody nose too many before we come to our senses. Itâ€™s a matter of very deeply ingrained habits of mind, right?

Well, I once shared that thought, and now Iâ€™m despairing even of that, and Iâ€™ll tell you why. Back in 2008, when President Obama was running for the first time â€” talk about a bloody nose. I mean, we had two bloody noses. The first was the catastrophic Iraq war. The was the financial collapse of that year. I entertained some brief hope that the two of them, the intersection of those two, would lead large numbers of American people to say, â€œWhat the hell is going on?â€

â€œLetâ€™s rethink.â€ And one could argue that the election of President Obama suggested a desire to see some rethinking, but it sure the heck didnâ€™t bear fruit.

I was in Hong Kong that morningâ€”it was morning for me when McCain capitulated, 11 at night your time.

And then the Grant Park speech?

I donâ€™t mind saying I wept. I thought, â€œWeâ€™ve redressed 150 years of our own history, and on the foreign side, the whole world is going to exhale.â€ That night in Hong Kong, not only every American there was out in the streetsâ€”the bars were crammedâ€”but many Chinese were, too. Everyone was relieved. Itâ€™s a measure of the disappointment to come, but thatâ€™s another line of inquiry.

Actually what you said I think is very interesting. There was something very important, symbolically important, in the election of an African-American. And the passage of time has by no means diminished the significance of his election in that regard. The problem was, it sort of reinforced na¯ve expectations that I think many Americans are susceptible to: that whoever the president happens to be, that person has the capability to change the world. And one of my great convictions has come to be that thatâ€™s totally malarkey.

That we may say, â€œThe president is the leader of the free world, the most powerful man in the world.â€ (Theyâ€™ve all been men.) But the truth is that presidents are constrained.

Ever more, Iâ€™d say.

Ever more. And that therefore, expectations that theyâ€™re going to have a transformative effect simply are na¯ve, and thatâ€™s what we have seen. In this president, who did inspire such extraordinary hopeâ€”and, yes, I agree with you, hope that extended beyond simply the American electorateâ€”heâ€™s not a bad president. Heâ€™s not a failure on the scale of George W. Bush. But heâ€™s been a disappointing president, even though heâ€™s disappointed because so many of us entertained these exaggerated expectations of what he was going to do. Had we had realistic expectations weâ€™d probably be saying, â€œWell, actually heâ€™s not done a very bad job.â€â€™

I mean, heâ€™s avoided catastrophes, which is not a bad standard.

I think that the Eisenhower revisionism, which seems to be pretty deeply rooted at this pointâ€”I think not too many people would say that Eisenhower was one of the greats: â€œHe deserved to be on Mount Rushmore.â€ But if we look at the run of presidents over the past 60 years or so, we still like Ike, because he avoided catastrophes.

Reading the book by your colleague, whatâ€™s his name? Senior moment. The New York Times correspondent. â€œThe Brothersâ€ [on Allen and John Foster Dulles].

Stephen Kinzer. It was a superb gathering of everything out there. For readers such as me, perfect. One of the things that comes over is that Eisenhower was a considerably more complex man than given credit for at the time and for many years thereafter. His resistance to this or that from the Dulles brothersâ€¦ I hope he gets his revisionist historian, and I certainly look forward to Obamaâ€™s presidential historians. I hope thereâ€™s somebody who can bring the complexities of his presidency out properly. Anyway, another conversation.

The question here: Who is more potent as an influence on policy now, or maybe the more detrimental to the development of a constructive one: liberals of the evangelical kind bent on a sort of neo-Wilsonian agenda, or traditional hawks such as McCain and others of a similar stripe? Neoliberals or conservatives, in other words.

Well, the answer to the question, in my mind, is both equally, because both tend to share the same expectations about what U.S. military power can do. The right wants to use military power to spread freedom. The left wants to use military power to protect the innocent, but both on the right and on the left, proponents of intervention lack a prudent understanding of what military power can do, what it canâ€™t do, and the likelihood of unintended secondary consequences that result from the use of military power.

The question of humanitarian intervention keeps popping up, particularly since the Clinton years. And now with Samantha Power, a person I have absolutely no time for at all, at the U.N., is this country, just speaking very plainly and realistically, is this country capable of a humanitarian intervention wherein we can keep our mitts off things and not turn it to some other-than-humanitarian purpose? Itâ€™s a practical question.

I think almost every so-called humanitarian intervention hasâ€”the proponents of intervention are using the humanitarian notion to justify action that actually derives from other purposes. One exception to that statement could well be the Somalian intervention that George Herbert Walker Bush initiated back in 1991, but I think if you look very deeply at things like Kosovo, at Bosnia, at Clintonâ€™s intervention in Haitiâ€”if you look very closely, under the humanitarian rhetoric, thereâ€™re other factors shaping U.S. policy. The real issue for me is that, for those who do genuinely believe that U.S. foreign policy should have a significant humanitarian dimension, I would urge them to think more deeply about why humanitarianism should express itself by sending in U.S. forces with guns. If we careâ€”if we genuinely care, letâ€™s say at the present moment, about the well-being of the Syrian peopleâ€”there are ways to alleviate the suffering of at least some of them without putting a single American soldier at risk. Put simply, remove the people who are in jeopardy from the dangers that they face. Bring them here. You want to save 200,000 Syrian lives? Good, then move 200,000 Syrian refugees from the awful, squalid camps that theyâ€™re inhabiting and letâ€™s resettle them here in the United States of America.

Now to say that, of course, one would immediately respond by saying, â€œThatâ€™s politically impossible! The American people who live in Iowa, or who live in Pennsylvania, or who live in New Mexico donâ€™t want 200,000 Syrian refugees in their midst.â€ My response would be: â€œYes, of course, thatâ€™s true. The impetus is not so much what can we do to benefit people who are suffering: The real impetus is, What can I do to ease my conscience because Iâ€™m bothered by all these people suffering. Oh yes, I know, letâ€™s send U.S. forces into the Syrian civil war, and thatâ€™ll make me feel better about our inaction.â€ Of course, to do that is to produce the results that you are suggestingâ€”simply, to make matters worse. There was an argument that we needed to depose Saddam Hussein because he was a cruel and oppressive dictator, but the consequences of deposing Saddam Hussein have not actually been very positiveâ€”

â€” as viewed from a humanitarian perspective. Indeed, we have, through our efforts in that country, produced instability, killed people, displaced people, and contributed to such vast human misery as to make a mockery of the humanitarian claims that, to some degree, provided the rationale for invading the country in the first place.

I had this question for later, but let me put it to you now. You mention in some of the things you write, it comes up all the time: public indifference. Itâ€™s reached an astonishing level.

I myself wonder if it hasnâ€™t been purposely cultivated after the uproar over Vietnam. About a month ago the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who is a Social Democrat, finished a year-long review of what the federal republic should do with its foreign policy looking out into the future. It had many different elements. As far as procedure is concerned, create a separate department in which people from all manner of disciplines are put in one room. So you have economists and development people and educators and military people and what have you all there. The policy to emerge is multidimensional. As he put it, there has to be something more than pointless conversation and shooting people.

[Laughs] Thatâ€™s pretty great. Is that the way he phrased it? More than talkingâ€”pointless talking and shooting people? [Laughs]

Anyway, here it is. Do you think itâ€™s realistic? I wrote a column about it; Iâ€™m very impressed with this guy. Of course, Social Democrats from Germany donâ€™t play well in America, but thatâ€™s all right. What do you think of this notion? The possibility of a more rounded policy in this country.

Iâ€™ll mention another question, since Iâ€™m scrambling them up. Herbert Croly, the great Progressive Era critic, distinguished between a nation with purpose and a nation with destiny. I donâ€™t think I have to explain the difference to you. Purpose gives you practical, earthly things to do. Destiny gives you ill-defined missions. Do you see that this is a transition we have to make, and can we see our way to something along the lines of what Steinmeier is talking about? Without being attacked as a bunch of milquetoasts who have lost our nerve? Is that the direction we need to go in?

Yes, I think so, and why wonâ€™t we? Well, because powerful people in powerful institutions are deeply invested in the status quo. I mean letâ€™s talk about the distribution of clout in the foreign policy establishment, where the Department of Defense wields such enormous authority, despite the fact that there is little evidence that the prevailing notions of national security actually produce very positive outcomes. Thereâ€™re a lot of people and a lot of institutions that benefit from our reigning understanding of national security. Certainly, the armed services, certainly the intelligence community, certainly the defense contractors. Certainly a variety of think tanks, even academic programsâ€”all would be loath to see Mr. Steinmeierâ€™s conception of statecraft be implemented. But this does get to your earlier point about public indifference, thatâ€”

I forgot to mention one thing about his program, his policies. The most important point, leading to this: He insists that foreign policy be removed from all sequestrationâ€”my word, not hisâ€”and involve the public so that a nationâ€™s activities abroad reflect the aspirations of its people. Thatâ€™s a big one. You know howâ€” Thatâ€™s a real big one! And again, for members of the foreign policy elite, why would they want to do that? Why would they wish to surrender their privileged position? Why would that want to open the game up to allow genuine involvement on the part of the American public? And thereâ€™s no need for them to do that, because the public has been so conditioned over the past 60 years to defer, to accept the fact that, of course, things must be done in secret, to accept the notion that thereâ€™s a cadre of people who are smarter than you and me, who possess insights and expertise to figure out how to navigate our way in a dangerous world. My answer to that would be: They donâ€™t have to â€œwant to do it.â€ They have to be made to do it. I donâ€™t care if they want it or not. I agree, but making that happen would require very intense pressure. The pressureâ€™s going to have to come from the American people, and the American people, having been conditioned to see their role as basically a passive one, donâ€™t do that. I mean, here as we sit, we are once more, whether we like it or not, involved in an Iraq war. The very fact that this new Iraq war has begun indicates that the previous Iraq war of 2003 to 2011 was a failure. A costly failure. A many-trillion-dollars failure. And yet, there is astonishingly little public interest in requiring any kind of accounting for that debacle. Here we are in the 14th year, weâ€™re approaching the 14th anniversary of the beginning of the Afghanistan war, which is another failure. The president says he wants us out of Afghanistan by the time he leaves the Oval Office, and that that would be part of his legacy. But is there any serious human being who thinks that when we leave Afghanistan we will be able to claim success? We are going to leave Afghanistan, and the Afghanistan war is going to continue. Well, where is the public outcry for an explanation of how the longest war in American history is on a course to end in failure. Why doesnâ€™t anybody care? Itâ€™s like that old movie â€œNetwork.â€ I canâ€™t remember the name of the protagonist in â€œNetwork.â€ â€œIâ€™m sick and tired of this and Iâ€™m not going to put up with it anymore!â€ But we live in a country of people that do put up with it. â€œIâ€™m mad as hell and Iâ€™m not going to take it anymore.â€ One of the things Kissinger taught us was that you canâ€™t conduct a foreign policy in the long term without domestic consensus. Thatâ€™s what we learned in April â€™75. Iâ€™m not sure thatâ€™s true anymore. You can if you have one thing: public indifference on a grand scale. As you say: All sorts of things in a majorly wrong direction are done without any kind of domestic objection. Iâ€™d like to turn to your new work in progress as you outlined it when you spoke in Providence. Youâ€™ve got 10 Theses to propose nailing to the door, Luther-like. Taking apart what you cast as a single war in its fourth decade across the Middle East. Can you expand on the core thought and the focus of the new work? Well, I have been struck by the extent to which the use of military forces since 1990 has tended to see them sent to various places in the Islamic world. When I was a young man growing up we fought in Asia, whether those wars were well-advised or not, but Americans fought and died in Korea, Americans fought and died in Vietnam. When I was a young man, Americans were willing to fight for Europe, maintain very large-scale U.S. forces in Europe until the end of the Cold War. But there was no particular interest in having Americans fight and die in the Islamic world. The single exception to that was Eisenhowerâ€™s very brief and entirely bloodless intervention in Lebanon, which was in 1958. All that began to change after Carterâ€™s promulgation of the Carter Doctrine, and since then, this is now three and half decades, we have had a long string of U.S. military interventions in the Islamic world. My argument is that, rather than seeing these various episodes as unrelated, we should see them as constituting one single war, much as the narrative of the Cold War includes U.S. forces going to Korea, it includes the Berlin airlift, it includes the Bay of Pigs, it includes intervention in El Salvadorâ€”a whole variety of episodes. Much the same can be said with regard to Reaganâ€™s intervention in Lebanon, George Herbert Walker Bushâ€™s intervention in Iraq, Bill Clintonâ€™s intervention in Bosnia and Kosovo, etc., etc., etc. Whether we are willing to acknowledge it or not, weâ€™ve been conducting a War for the Greater Middle East that began in 1980 and continues to the present day. Further, Iâ€”my new bookâ€”will argue that that war isnâ€™t going well. That three and a half decades later, we havenâ€™t won it, weâ€™re not winning it, and the likelihood of simply continuing down the path that weâ€™re on, with the expectation that final victory lies out there just over the horizon, is an absurdity. So thereâ€™s great need, in the midst of this war, to recognize that it is a war and to take stock of it. It opens the mind, just a single construct. It opens us to all kinds of new understandings. You have a professionalâ€™s knowledge of the military, and more exposure than most to the national security apparatus, which you call â€œa dead zoneâ€ when it comes to new ideas. â€œScleroticâ€ is another one of your terms. Could you talk about the actual state of the American military and the national security bureaucracy? I have to assume weâ€™re not talking about 1.3 million Beetle Baileys, but what have we got in terms ofâ€”people who are opposed to these wars probably donâ€™t care, but putting that asideâ€”Iâ€™m just curious, what do we have by way of a fighting force and a national security apparatus? Are these sound institutions, or are they in a certain state of not really decay butâ€”I donâ€™t know what the word is, Andrewâ€¦ I think the word is stagnation. On the one hand, thereâ€™s no question that the U.S. military today possesses enormous capabilities. Whatâ€™s not apparent is that those capabilities are relevant to the political challenges that we face, in particular, in the Islamic world. So it is a instrument not well-suited to dealing with the problems where we have insisted on applying it. And sadly, members of the officer corps by and large lack the willingness to confront the consistent failure of our military actions in that region. Itâ€™s interesting that there are a considerable number of general officers who, once they retire, go public with their critique of U.S. policy. Yes, one does notice that. I donâ€™t have a sense that that critique is being voicedâ€”I donâ€™t mean writing op-eds in the New York Timesâ€”but the critical thinking is occurring when those officers are on active duty. And what we get instead, of course, is the recitation of platitudes about having the best soldiers in the world and the best military that the world has ever seen. And yet, an absence of taking stock and an absence of measuring outcomesâ€”of acknowledging costs. In the same line, what is your view, as a retired professional, of our dependence on tens of thousands of private contractorsâ€”in blunt terms, mercenaries. Can you address cause and effect in this question? After Vietnam, actually toward the end of Vietnam, I should say, when President Nixon terminated the draft, something he did for cynical political reasons, the effect was to abandon the tradition of the citizen soldier and to base the American military system on the idea of a professional soldier. So we created what the founders of this republic would have called â€œa standing army.â€ Founders of this republic viewed the standing army as a suspect institution and inappropriate for a republican form of government, but thatâ€™s what we did. And, indeed, for a period of time, through to 9/11, the American people generally speaking endorsed that move from a citizen soldier to a professional soldier. It seemed like we were getting good value for the money and it certainly removed obligations from citizens to farm out national security to a special class. A not-inconsiderable cause of the indifference we were talking about earlier. Oh, of course. After 9/11, when the Bush administrationâ€™s miscalculationsâ€” twofold: one, thinking the Afghanistan war was won when it wasnâ€™t; two, thinking that the Iraq War would be won easily by a relatively small forceâ€”at that point, letâ€™s say weâ€™re talking 2004, we suddenly find ourselves engaged in these two wars, needing a lot more soldiers than we have. And a lot more soldiers than we can produce if relying on volunteers. So youâ€™ve got too much war, too few warriors, what do you do? Well, I think the preference would have been to turn to our loyal allies and have them make up the difference. But our allies were either unwilling or unable to fill the gap. Theyâ€™re just not on for them, a lot of what we haveâ€” Well, theyâ€™re not on for it, and theyâ€™re also actuallyâ€”the Europeans felt disarmed. You know, the notion that there is a big British army or a big French army or a big German army that can supplement U.S. forces is simply no longer the case. The bottom line is, if youâ€™ve got too much war and too few warriors, you fill the gap by hiring mercenaries, which we did, and which turned out to be not especially effective and to cause huge complications while imposing enormous financial costs. So we end up with this truly bizarre situation, which, again, everybody knows about and yet remains indifferent to. Weâ€™re at the height of the Iraq war and the height of the Afghanistan war. We have more contractors in those theaters than we do soldiers. It is truly an astonishing fact, but itâ€™s a fact that quite literally doesnâ€™t matter in any meaningful political sense. As a practical matter it doesnâ€™t matter. It doesnâ€™t matter any more than having trillion-dollar deficits. If you say to the average American, â€œDo you like trillion-dollar deficits?â€ â€œNo!â€ But that doesnâ€™t translate into some sort of collective outrage that is going to result in a balanced budget. â€œDo you like having mercenaries?â€ â€œNo!â€ But that doesnâ€™t translate into any outrage tha
