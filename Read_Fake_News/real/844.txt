Former President Bill Clinton might want to keep the racism accusations to himself from now on -- after ripping Donald Trump for a slogan he's used repeatedly since his 'Comeback Kid' days.

The 42nd president on Wednesday, while stumping in Orlando for Hillary Clinton, suggested Trumpâ€™s campaign rallying cry, â€œMake America Great Again,â€ is racist code.

â€œIâ€™m actually old enough to remember the good old days, and they werenâ€™t all that good in many ways,â€ Clinton said. â€œThat message where â€Iâ€™ll give you America great againâ€™ is if youâ€™re a white Southerner, you know exactly what it means, donâ€™t you?â€

The crowd roared as Clinton continued. â€œWhat it means is â€Iâ€™ll give you an economy you had 50 years ago, and Iâ€™ll move you back up on the social totem pole and other people down,â€™â€ he said.

The problem is, Clinton himself has used the same phrase several times in the past.

He used it repeatedly while running for president in 1991 and 1992, declaring at one Little Rock, Ark., event, "Together, we can make America great again."

And in a campaign ad for his wife in 2008, Bill Clinton said, "It's time for another comeback, time to make America great again."

Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway pointed to the inconvenient footage in calling the former president's allegations about Trump's slogan a "disgrace." 



â€œThat performance is really something,â€ she said Friday on â€œFox & Friends.â€ â€œBill Clinton is known as a very strong campaigner, a great voice in politics -- but not this cycle.â€
