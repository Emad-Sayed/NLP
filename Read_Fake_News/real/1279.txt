Donald Trump publicly raised questions about Hillary Clintonâ€™s health for the first time since the former secretary of state was forced on Sunday to leave a ceremony for the victims of 9/11.

Speaking in an air-conditioned minor league basketball arena in Canton, Ohio, Trump made his most direct reference to Clintonâ€™s recent diagnosis of pneumonia and her campaign saying she left the event in New York because she felt â€œoverheatedâ€.

â€œYou think this is easy?â€ Trump asked. â€œIn this beautiful room thatâ€™s 122 degrees. It is hot, and it is always hot when I perform because the crowds are so big. The rooms were not designed for this kind of crowd. I donâ€™t know, folks. You think Hillary Clinton would be able to stand up here and do this for an hour? I donâ€™t know.â€

The Republican nominee later went on to add of his Democratic rival, â€œNow sheâ€™s lying in bed, getting better and we want her better, we want her back on the trail, right?â€

Sounding like the classic unscripted Trump, the Republican presidential nominee often deviated from his teleprompters in a 40-minute speech that ranged from Clintonâ€™s health to the water crisis in Flint, Michigan.

The issue of candidate health and medical records has come to the forefront after the Clinton campaign revealed on Sunday â€“ eight hours after she abruptly left the ceremony at the National September 11 Memorial â€“ that the former secretary of state had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier. The Democratic nominee had to be helped into a van while leaving. Afterward, Clinton cancelled all public events for three days.

Clinton has since released more detailed medical information from her doctor describing her as â€œhealthy and fit to serve as presidentâ€. In contrast, Trump has yet to share further medical information to the public besides a brief letter written in December that said he would be â€œthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidencyâ€. However, in an interview with controversial TV doctor Dr Oz, set to air on Thursday, the 70-year-old Trump reportedly said that he would like to lose 15 pounds, doesnâ€™t exercise and is fond of fast food.

Trump also addressed the water crisis in Flint, a former car manufacturing hub that has seen tens of thousands of jobs disappear in recent decades. â€œIt used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldnâ€™t drink the water in Mexico,â€ the Republican nominee said. â€œNow the cars are made in Mexico and you canâ€™t drink the water in Flint.â€ Ford said on Wednesday that it was moving all its small-car production to Mexico.

Earlier in the day, Trump had visited the city and ended up in a confrontation with a local pastor. Trump was visiting a church that serves as a water distribution center for residents when he started critiquing Clinton. The pastor, Faith Green Timmons, interrupted and made clear: â€œMr Trump, I invited you here to thank us for what weâ€™ve done in Flint, not give a political speech.â€

Later in Ohio, Trump, buoyed by recent polls that showed him taking the lead in that crucial swing state, was in high spirits in front of a cheering crowd. His supporters, many of them wearing Trump-themed apparel, ate up applause lines such as when Trump asked who would pay for his famous border wall. He received loud shouts in return of â€œMexicoâ€.

The crowd also booed and hissed when Trump told them, â€œPresident Obama just announced a 30% increase to refugee admissions coming into this country.â€ Trump added after the loud chorus of boos subsided that â€œthat was hard to takeâ€. The Republican nominee added of the proposal: â€œItâ€™s bringing the total to 110,000 refugees in just a single year, and we have no idea where they come from, itâ€™s a great Trojan horse.â€ Looking ahead to historyâ€™s judgment, Trump noted, â€œI donâ€™t want be known in 200 years for having created a Trojan horse by a different name.â€

The uncharacteristic return to his unscripted rally style comes the day before the Republican nominee is scheduled to make a major economic policy speech at the Waldorf Astoria in New York. There, the Republican nominee will introduce a tax reform proposal.

Trump has previously introduced two other tax reform plans. First, in 2015, where he emphasized that half of Americans in lieu of paying taxes would simply mail a card to the IRS saying â€œI winâ€, and more recently in August where he proposed to reduce the number of tax brackets to three while drastically cutting rates. The speech on Thursday is expected to be a more expansive elaboration of the August proposal.
