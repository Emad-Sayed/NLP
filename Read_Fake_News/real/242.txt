Sen. Ted Cruzâ€™s national spokesman Rick Tyler doubled-down on Friday following accusations that the campaign Photoshopped an image of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and President Obama.

â€œEvery picture in a political campaign is Photoshopped,â€ Tyler told Fox News. â€œIt is absolutely true.â€

When pressed repeatedly by host Martha McCallum about why the campaign Photoshopped a picture of Rubio and Obama shaking hands in a picture on a website produced by the Cruz campaign, Tyler instead took aim at Rubioâ€™s record.

â€œMarco Rubio and Barack Obama have shaken hands. There are plenty of photos of him shaking hands,â€ he said. â€œIf they donâ€™t like the picture we picked, then send me a picture they like of Marco Rubio shaking hands with Barack Obama and weâ€™ll swap it out.â€

The website, which features other digitally altered images of the Florida senator, offers visitors the chance to take a â€œstand against Rubio,â€ with a link to Ted Cruzâ€™s get-out-the-vote site.

"This is a disturbing pattern, they are making stuff up every day," Rubio told reporters Thursday.

Rubio senior advisor Todd Harris said the body shown in the image in question is "not Rubio."

â€œThis person, we donâ€™t know who that is, but they Photoshopped Marcoâ€™s face onto somebody else. This is how phony and how deceitful the Cruz campaign has become.â€

The campaign says the original image, apparently reversed, was from a stock photograph.
