A key operative in a Democratic scheme to send agitators to cause unrest at Donald Trumpâ€™s rallies has visited the White House 342 times since 2009, White House records show.

Robert Creamer, who acted as a middle man between the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and â€œprotestersâ€ who tried â€” and succeeded â€” to provoke violence at Trump rallies met with President Obama during 47 of those 342 visits, according to White House records. Creamerâ€™s last visit was in June 2016.

Creamer, whose White House visits were first pointed out by conservative blog Weasel Zippers, is stepping back from his role within the Clinton campaign. (RELATED: Second Oâ€™Keefe Video Shows Dem Operative Boasting About Voter Fraud)

Hidden camera video from activist James Oâ€™Keefe showed Creamer bragging that his role within the Clinton campaign was to oversee the work of Americans United for Change, a non-profit organization that sent activists to Trump rallies.

Scott Foval, the national field director for Americans United for Change, explained how the scheme works.

â€œThe [Clinton] campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval Group, The Foval Group goes and executes the shit,â€ Foval told an undercover journalist.

One example of the â€œshitâ€ Foval executes was an instance in which a 69-year-old woman garnered headlines after claiming to be assaulted at a Trump rally.

â€œShe was one of our activists,â€ Foval said.

Creamerâ€™s job was to â€œmanageâ€ the work carried out by Foval.

â€œAnd the Democratic Party apparatus and the people from the campaign, the Clinton campaign and my role with the campaign, is to manage all that,â€ Creamer told an undercover journalist.

â€œWherever Trump and Pence are gonna be we have events,â€ he said.
