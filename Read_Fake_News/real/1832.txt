In every presidential campaign, there are issues everyone knows beforehand will be discussed â€” what should we do about immigration, how can we improve the economy, where should we go on health care â€” and events that become campaign issues when they burst into the news. So it is with the public health crisis in Flint, Michigan, where a public health catastrophe has played out over the last two years, and more and more politicians are being asked to comment on it.

To get you up to speed, in 2014, in an effort to save money, the city stopped getting its water from Detroit and began getting it from the contaminated Flint River. It turned out that all manner of nasty chemicals were contained in the water, most alarmingly, lead. Itâ€™s important to understand that at the time, Flintâ€™s own elected officials were all but powerless, because the city was being run by a â€œemergency managerâ€ appointed by Michigan governor Rick Snyder; it was the emergency manager who made the final call to switch their water supply (you can read more about that here). Emails released yesterday by Snyderâ€™s administration show that as Flint residents were complaining about the waterâ€™s color and taste, and reporting ill health effects, state officials were not particularly eager to do anything about it. Snyderâ€™s chief of staff wrote in one email that other state officials felt that â€œsome in Flint are taking the very sensitive issue of childrenâ€™s exposure to lead and trying to turn it into a political football.â€

Well itâ€™s a political football now â€” as well it should be. Iâ€™ve long been an advocate of â€œpoliticizingâ€ just about everything (see here or here), not because candidates should take any excuse to blame each other for anything going wrong anywhere in the country, but because elected officials need to make choices, and campaigns provide an opportunity to get them on record saying how theyâ€™d address critical issues. Right after a hurricane is the best time to talk about what government should do to prepare for disasters, just as the aftermath of a high-profile police shooting is the best time to talk about police practices. Itâ€™s when our attention gets focused on a problem and thereâ€™s a real opportunity to make progress.

So what weâ€™re seeing now is that Democrats, particularly President Obama and those running for his partyâ€™s presidential nomination, are eager to talk about Flint. Obama met with Flintâ€™s mayor, declared a state of emergency that will allow federal funds to flow there, and called the crisis â€œinexplicable and inexcusable.â€ Hillary Clinton raised it in Sundayâ€™s debate when asked what issue she wish had been brought up but hadnâ€™t, saying, â€œWeâ€™ve had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didnâ€™t really care. He had requests for help that he basically stonewalled. Iâ€™ll tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there wouldâ€™ve been action.â€ For his part, Bernie Sanders called for Snyder to resign.

And the Republicans? It wonâ€™t be surprising if they arenâ€™t interested in discussing the race and class issues the crisis raises, and thus far, they donâ€™t seem to want to talk seriously about it at all. Ben Carson was the first to give any substantive comment, placing the blame on Flintâ€™s elected officials and the federal government, neatly excusing Governor Snyderâ€™s administration of any involvement. Marco Rubio was asked about it on Monday and said he couldnâ€™t say much, since â€œThatâ€™s not an issue that right now weâ€™ve been focused onâ€; from what I can tell he hasnâ€™t said anything about it since. Donald Trump was also reluctant to discuss it, responding to a reporterâ€™s question on Tuesday by saying, â€œA thing like that shouldnâ€™t happen, but, again, I donâ€™t want to comment on that.â€ John Kasich said, â€œI think the governor has moved the National Guard in and, you know, Iâ€™m sure he will manage this appropriately.â€ I havenâ€™t been able to find any comments from Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rand Paul, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, or Rick Santorum.

But there is one Republican candidate who made detailed remarks about the issue: Ted Cruz. â€œIt is a failure at every level of government, a failure of the city officials, a failure of the county officials, and the men and women of Michigan have been betrayed,â€ Cruz said. â€œEvery American is entitled to have access to clean water. And to all the children who have been poisoned by government officials, by their negligence, by their ineptitude, itâ€™s heart-breaking.â€ In addition, Cruzâ€™s Michigan state director wrote on her Facebook page that the campaign was bringing bottled water to â€œcrisis pregnancy centersâ€ in the city, which try to convince women not to have abortions.

Cruz did his best to fit the issue in with his broader critique of government, but it isnâ€™t surprising that the rest of his Republican colleagues didnâ€™t really want to talk about it. If Snyder were a Democrat, you can be sure theyâ€™d be blaming him, but he isnâ€™t. They arenâ€™t going to say that this disaster demonstrates that the problems that affect poor and black people are given less attention by government at all levels than the problems that affect rich and white people, because most of them donâ€™t think thatâ€™s actually true. They arenâ€™t going to say that this shows that we need a major investment in infrastructure spending in America, because they donâ€™t really believe that, either.

But those are the broader issues that the catastrophe in Flint raises, and thatâ€™s what the candidates ought to be pressed on. They donâ€™t even have to agree on who bears the lionâ€™s share of the blame to agree that we have a national problem that requires attention. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the countryâ€™s drinking water system a grade of â€œDâ€ and says that in the next couple of decades we will need to invest hundreds of billions of dollars, perhaps even into the trillions, in order to bring the system up to where it should be.

So now that weâ€™re focusing on the question of drinking water, the candidates should say what they see as our infrastructure priorities, how we should address them, how much we ought to spend, and how that fits in with the other things theyâ€™d like to spend money on.
