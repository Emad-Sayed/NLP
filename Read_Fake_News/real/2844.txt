Donald Trump voters praise him for 'telling it like it is.' But the appeal of his plain-speaking runs much deeper.

How SNL's 'the bubble' sketch about polarization is all too true

Ron Herndon needs more than 10 fingers to count the ways Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump rubs him the wrong way, not least the billionaireâ€™s quest for personal aggrandizement via the White House.

So why is the small-town barbecue shack owner, a registered Democrat, likely voting for Mr. Trump if he wins the GOP nomination?

â€œAmerica is at the point where she needs someone who speaks the truth, to say what we all think but wonâ€™t say around strangers,â€ says Mr. Herndon. â€œSometimes the truth makes you smile â€“ and sometimes it hurts.â€

Herndonâ€™s view is that America needs a straight-talking president to tackle real-life problems long ignored by Washington. It has become a common refrain.

The views of this African-American pit master suggest that many Americans are curious about Trump not just because he brazenly breaks the rules of political rhetoric but also because the key to tackling Americaâ€™s problems, they say, requires people to stop taking offense at the drop of a hat.

In that way, Trump is the symbol of a broader cultural tension. As many Millennials, in particular, become more militant in their desire to make public discourse inclusive, they are coming up against those tired of â€œwars against Christmasâ€ or tentative talk about Islamic extremism.

For Millennials, who have grown up in the language of political correctness, speech is a weapon, and curtailing words that can be seen as offensive or hateful is a new civil-rights frontier. But Trumpâ€™s unfiltered speech encapsulates a potent backlash, with many conservative Americans trying to draw the line on how cautious and careful public conversation becomes.

â€œThe big difference with Trump is, his language is not coded,â€ says Henry Giroux, a political scientist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and author of the upcoming book â€œAmerica At War With Itself,â€ which largely focuses on the rise of Trump.

Trumpâ€™s words â€œtap into is a nation that really has been suffering, particularly since 9/11, from a kind of national insecurity state, mobilized by a massive sense of fear,â€ he adds. But Millennials see in such language a â€œdarkness lurking beneath the surface.â€

On Super Tuesday, Trump continued his trend of underperforming among voters age 18 to 29. But he did well among New England suburbanites, Southern Evangelicals, small businessmen, and blue-collar workers, among others.

At least partly behind Trumpâ€™s success is the perception that political correctness has morphed into â€œsoft totalitarianism,â€ wrote James Kalb wrote in Chronicles Magazine late last year.

â€œThe domination of public life by PC elites has â€¦ made it impossible for ordinary people to assert their complaints publicly in an acceptable way, so their objections can easily be shrugged off as the outbursts of ignorant bigots who will, in any event, soon become demographically irrelevant.â€

Antipathy toward political correctness spans a wide spectrum of Americans, many whom use the phrase as a pejorative.

Seventy-one percent of Americans say political correctness is a problem in the United States, up 10 percentage points from 2014, according to an August 2015 report by Rasmussen Reports.

At the Pawn Depot, situated on a lonely stretch of US 278 in Lithonia, Ga., that concern is front-of-mind.

Elizabeth Langbecker, the owner, is a Trump fan because he â€œrefuses to tip-toeâ€ around immigration, the economy, and terrorism.

â€œWe need someone who is not afraid to step up to the plate and say what a lot of us want to say,â€ she adds.

She weighs the Obama administration's efforts to downplay the phrase "Islamic extremismâ€ against the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings last year, where a Muslim couple killed 14 people and injured 22 others. â€œHow can we deal with all these problems if we canâ€™t even have an honest conversation about the root cause,â€ she says.

In the 2016 race, political correctness has played out in a number of ways. On one hand, Hillary Clinton apologized for using the term â€œillegal immigrantâ€ as opposed to â€œundocumented migrant.â€ But there have been examples on the right, too. Republican orthodoxy has long held that candidates should not criticize past Republican presidents.

Trump has torn that to shreds.

â€œYes, itâ€™s true that on college campuses thereâ€™s a lot of silliness about not wanting to offend someone,â€ says Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. â€œBut itâ€™s also on the conservative side â€“ which Trump has also been violating â€“ where you couldnâ€™t say the Iraq War was a mistake or â€¦ that Romney was going to loseâ€ the 2012 election.

Now those things are being said loudly. One difference is a sense of desperation in many rural, red-state areas.

â€œPopulism needs to be a loud message, and political incorrectness is high volume,â€ says Dave â€œMudcatâ€ Saunders of Roanoke, Va. The backdrop â€œis not just anger, but survival â€“ weâ€™re in survival mode out here where 93 percent of counties are still in recession. A hungry dog will bite your [rear], I can tell you that.â€

That desperation has matched the militancy of Millennials looking to reshape the national conversation with the militancy of conservatives pushing back against it. The answer, says The Atlanticâ€™s Conor Friedersdorf, is to prune political correctness back to its original essence.

â€œCitizens who oppose Trumpism are going to have to take a careful look at everything that falls under the rubric of political correctness; study the real harm done by its excesses; identify the many parts that are worth defending; and persuade more Americans to adopt those norms voluntarily, for substantive reasons, not under duress of social shaming or other coercion,â€ he writes.

Working on the set of the vampire series â€œThe Originalsâ€ in downtown Conyers, Ga., last week, 20-something Michael Sanders says, to him, political correctness is a â€œforce from on highâ€ â€“ the media, government, and academia â€“ that has pervaded his life.

â€œMe and everyone I grew up with have always used the language of political correctness,â€ he says. â€œWhen we talk about phrases like â€illegal immigrant,â€™ my dad says, â€Thatâ€™s just the way people used to talk.â€™ â€

On one hand, it enforces common courtesy. But there is an appeal, he adds, to someone who comes out and baldly talks from the standpoint of the worldview that used to be dominant.

â€œI think many Americans like to hear the language of someone not only willing to complain about the end of white dominant culture, but someone who says he can do something about it. Thatâ€™s when [political correctness] goes out the window.â€
