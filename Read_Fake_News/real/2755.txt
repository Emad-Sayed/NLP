President Obama uttered more than 3,600 words on the stage of Washingtonâ€™s Marriott Wardman Park ballroom on Tuesday, but his message could be summed up in three: You wouldnâ€™t dare.

He was speaking not to the hundreds of hospital administrators assembled for the Catholic Health Associationâ€™s conference but to five men not in the room: the conservative justices of the Supreme Court, who in the next 21 days will declare whether they are invalidating the most far-reaching legislation in at least a generation because of one vague clause tucked in its 2,000 pages.

Obamaâ€™s appeal to the justices, devotees of judicial modesty all: Do they really wish to cause the massive societal upheaval that would come from killing a law that is now a routine part of American life?

â€œFive years in, what we are talking about is no longer just a law. Itâ€™s no longer just a theory. It isnâ€™t even just about the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare,â€ he said. â€œThis is now part of the fabric of how we care for one another. This is health care in America.â€

Without mentioning the looming decision, Obama warned of its devastating potential. â€œOnce you see millions of people having health care, once you see that all the bad things that were predicted didnâ€™t happen, youâ€™d think that itâ€™d be time to move on,â€ he said. â€œIt seems so cynical to want to take coverage away from millions of people, to take care away from the people who need it the most, to punish millions with higher costs of care and unravel whatâ€™s now been woven into the fabric of America.â€

The appearance had been scheduled long ago, but White House officials elevated the importance of the speech to keep pressure on the Supreme Court, which Obama said at a news conference in Germany on Monday shouldnâ€™t have even taken up the case. Obama said trashing the federal health-care exchanges, as a hostile Supreme Court ruling would do, is â€œnot something that should be done based on a twisted interpretation of four words.â€

The conservative justices, like conservative critics of the law generally, are unlikely to be persuaded by Obamaâ€™s recitation of the merits of the law, which he repeated at length Tuesday. But they may well be reluctant to upend a law that now has broad acceptance in American society.

The Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks public opinion on the matter, found in April that more Americans had a favorable view of the law than an unfavorable view (43 percent to 42 percent) for the first time since 2012. That difference is not statistically significant, but the favorable view is up 10 points since the botched HealthCare.gov rollout in 2013 and the unfavorable view is down seven points. Forty-six percent favor keeping the law as is or expanding it, compared with 41 percent who favor scaling it back or repealing it.

More evidence of the acceptance of Obamacare: Health care is fading as an issue. Gallup found last month that only 5 percent called it the countryâ€™s most important problem. That compares with 26 percent in September 2009.

Certainly, those numbers could change if premiums jump as expected. But the recent improvement in the lawâ€™s standing comes even though most Americans arenâ€™t aware that the law has cost the government less than forecast.

With such broad acceptance of (if not fondness for) the new health-care status quo, itâ€™s difficult to imagine the Supreme Court justices taking away health coverage for 6 million or 7 million Americans, causing costs to skyrocket for millions of others, and likely plunging the entire American health-care system into chaos. Thatâ€™s not just judicial activism â€” it would be a judicially induced cataclysm.

Such a cataclysm has no place in the catechism of Sister Carol Keehan, head of the Catholic Health Association and a key early supporter of Obamacare who broke with the Catholic bishops to support the law.

â€œIt would be unspeakably cruel,â€ she said when I asked her after the conference Tuesday what an adverse Supreme Court ruling would produce. Millions of people â€” pregnant women, cancer victims, heart patients â€” would lose coverage, she said. â€œThe panic is going to spread, the confusion. Itâ€™s going to be incredibly chaotic.â€ And, with Congress unable to agree even on little things, the chaos would persist.

â€œIt makes me crazy just to think of it,â€ Keehan said, urging me to â€œlight a candleâ€ as the justices prepare their opinion.

Iâ€™ll leave the votive offering to Sister Carol. I have faith that the conservative justices, even if they detest Obamacare, have no wish to throw the country into chaos.
