Marco Rubio is in an enviable position among mainstream Republican presidential candidates after his strong finish in Iowa. Yet the man is running scared.

The young Floridian is stumping through New Hampshire as if heâ€™s campaigning to win the Cautious Caucus. He gives the same speech everywhere. The most tightly managed candidate in the race, he shuns risk and appears to live in mortal terror of mentioning the man who dominates the race.

At a town hall event here in central New Hampshire on Wednesday morning, Rubio, as usual, didnâ€™t mention Donald Trump in his speech. But the first questioner, a businesswoman, practically begged the candidate to trash Trump, asking him to comment on Trumpâ€™s â€œvery definite viewsâ€ of the disabled, including calling people â€œstupidâ€ and attempting to remove disabled veterans from one of his properties.

Rubio demurred, saying only that he had already called out â€œDonaldâ€ for his â€œdistastefulâ€ mocking of a disabled reporter at an event. He then dropped the Trump talk and moved on.

Rival Chris Christie mocked Rubio on Tuesday as â€œthe boy in the bubbleâ€ managed by his â€œhandlers.â€ This criticism apparently smoked Rubio out, because he took a few questions from reporters before his event in Laconia, N.H., on Wednesday afternoon.

The first questioner noted that Rubio had poked other candidates, â€œbut not Mr. Trump. Why?â€

â€œDonald hasnâ€™t really outlined any position on policies,â€ Rubio reasoned. â€œSo when the time comes and itâ€™s appropriate, weâ€™ll do so.â€

â€œWhy do you deliver the same speech wherever you go?â€ the second questioner asked.

â€œâ€™Cause itâ€™s my message,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s the reason Iâ€™m running for president.â€

Rubioâ€™s determination not to be taken off of this bland message, or to engage Trump, may give the impression that he is above the fray. But it also can make him look weak and callow.

While other candidates, particularly Jeb Bush, have denounced Trumpâ€™s outrages, Rubio and allied groups have spent upward of $30 million on ads so far â€” some of it targeting Bush, Christie and Ted Cruz, but none of it targeting Trump. Rubio has mentioned Trump a couple of times on Twitter. In debates, he has frequently deflects questions about the mogul.

After the December debate, in which Rubio declined a chance to take on Trumpâ€™s proposed ban on Muslims entering the country, Fox News asked Rubio why he hadnâ€™t gone after Trump. Rubio said he wasnâ€™t â€œgoing to spend a valuable 75 seconds on a debate stage talking about something thatâ€™s never going to happen.â€

Likewise, asked to comment on Trumpâ€™s qualifications as a conservative, Rubio said that the billionaire is â€œrunning as someone whoâ€™s a populist whoâ€™s upset about the direction of this country, as am I, as are millions of Americans.â€

On other occasions, Rubio declined to talk about Trumpâ€™s mosque-closing ideas (â€œwell, I think we need to target radicalismâ€) and Trumpâ€™s plan for mass deportation of illegal immigrants (both sides â€œhave points to make here that are validâ€).

Asked back in September whether he would engage Trump, Rubio replied: â€œNo, Iâ€™m ready to talk about who I am and why Iâ€™m running.â€

Itâ€™s not as if Trump returns the politeness. Ann Coulter, warming up a Trump crowd Tuesday night, called Rubio a â€œCuban boyâ€ who â€œwears high heelsâ€ and has â€œbig ears.â€ (Ever-cautious Rubio, ridiculed last month for wearing â€œbootiesâ€ with thick heels, quickly retired the offending footwear.)

Rubioâ€™s strong Iowa finish has brought new attention â€” and overcapacity crowds â€” in New Hampshire. But the would-be supporters are greeted by a robot.

The closest Rubio gets to Trump in his stump speech is observing, as he did here in Bow, that â€œyou have a right to be angry, but anger is not a plan. What exactly do you want to do?â€ Or, as he put it in Laconia a few hours later: â€œAnger is not a plan. Frustration is not a plan. You have a right to be frustrated. You have a right to be angry. .â€‰.â€‰. But what exactly are you going to do about it?â€

Votersâ€™ questions, rather than spurring spontaneity, inspire more caution. Asked Wednesday what heâ€™d do about the millions of illegal immigrants who otherwise havenâ€™t broken any law, Rubio said, â€œWeâ€™ll figure something out.â€

The logic behind Rubioâ€™s candidacy, recited in his speeches, is that, as he put it in Bow: â€œI give us the best chance to win, and if you donâ€™t believe me, ask a Democrat. They do not want to run against me.â€ Or, as he said in Laconia: â€œIf Iâ€™m our nominee, we will win, and the Democrats know this. They do not want to run against me.â€

If he keeps playing the boy in the bubble, they may reconsider.
