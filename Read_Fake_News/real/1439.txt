Predators, by and large, do not attack the strongest prey in the wild. They instead target the vulnerable, the very young, and the very oldâ€”the prey that is least able to defend itself. Trump University, the defunct real-estate education program created by presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, pursued a similar approach, according to its former employees in legal documents unsealed Tuesday. The Art of the Upsell: How Donald Trump Profits From 'Free' Seminars â€œBased upon my personal experience and employment, I believe that Trump University was a fraudulent scheme, and that it preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money,â€ said Ronald Schnackenberg, a sales manager at Trump University in 2006 and 2007. Those declarations and other internal Trump University documents depict an aggressive, ethically dubious business model that targeted potential customersâ€™ financial fears and socioeconomic anxieties and offered Trumpâ€™s personal brand as the solutionâ€”a strategy later echoed in his presidential campaign.

In his declaration, Schnackenberg recounted meeting a couple after a live event in New York City in 2007. Apparently swayed by the presentation, they expressed an interest in purchasing a $35,000 Trump Gold Elite program, the most expensive tier available. â€œI did not think it was an appropriate program for them because of their precarious financial conditionâ€”they had no money to pay for the program, but would have had to pay for the program using disability income and taking out a loan based upon equity in his apartment,â€ he testified. â€œTrump University reprimanded me for not trying harder to sell the program to this couple.â€ A different salesperson closed the deal with them. â€œI was disgusted by this conduct and decided to resign,â€ Schnackenberg said. Schnackenberg made the declaration in September 2012â€”about three years before Donald Trump announced his presidential bidâ€”as part of a class-action lawsuit against the businessman by former Trump University customers. The declaration and other trial documents remained under seal until Tuesday after federal judge Gonzalo Curielâ€”a newfound target of Trumpâ€™s stump-speech angerâ€”ordered many of them to be made public Friday in response to a public-interest motion by the Washington Post. For a Trump University employee, failure simply meant the abstract loss of potential profit. For a Trump University student, however, failure could mean financial ruin.

Official scripts and guidelines in Trump Universityâ€™s sales playbooks harnessed this fear to drive prospective buyers towards the product. During one-on-one sessions after the $1,500 second-tier seminar, the playbook encouraged salespeople to assess each customerâ€™s fears, goals, and financial status, then â€œclose the dealâ€ on the next tier of seminars. â€œWhen you introduce the price, donâ€™t make it sound like you think itâ€™s a lot of money, if you donâ€™t make a big deal out of it they wonâ€™t,â€ the playbook advises. â€œIf they can afford the gold elite donâ€™t allow them to think about anything besides the gold elite.â€ The Trump Gold Elite package, which included a series of retreats, a three-day â€œin-field mentorship,â€ and a free trial on foreclosure-tracking software, cost $35,000. If the customer hesitated, the playbook offered a sample text to â€œpush them out of their comfort zoneâ€ by criticizing their financial status. â€œItâ€™s time for you to be 100% honest with yourself,â€ the suggested text read. â€œYouâ€™ve had your entire adult life to accomplish your financial goals. Iâ€™m looking at your profile and youâ€™re not even close to where you need to be, much less where you want to be. Itâ€™s time to fix your broken plan, bring in Mr. Trumpâ€™s top instructors and certified millionaire mentors and allow us to put you and keep you on the right track. Your plan is BROKEN and WE WILL help you fix it.â€ The playbook also includes rebuttals to common concerns about spending up to $35,000 on a series of seminars. For example, if customers want to try real-estate investing on their own, salespeople were told to pepper them with technical questions about their business plan, apparently to undermine their self-confidence.

â€œHow are you going to locate the properties? How are you determining ARV? All cash offer? Where is your financing coming from? How will you negotiate price? Terms? What about exit strategies?â€ the playbook offers as suggested dialogue. â€œOne mistake on any one of these and youâ€™re broke, beaten, and worse off than you are now.â€ â€œYou can ask them questions so they realize they donâ€™t have a chance for long term or short term success,â€ the playbook then reminds the employee. Amidst this sea of imagined dangers, the salesperson would then pivot to pitch Trump University as a lifeboat. â€œThe risk isnâ€™t spending 35K â€“ itâ€™s entering into the world of REAL ESTATE without specialized knowledge, guidance and trained professionals in the field holding your hand,â€ the playbookâ€™s rebuttals said. â€œWE are the safe decision.â€ The playbook frequently tells Trump University employees to lean on the instructorsâ€™ and mentorsâ€™ wisdom as a selling point. But Jason Nichols, a Trump University sales executive who worked for the company in 2007, challenged this depiction in his declaration to the court. â€œThe Trump University instructors and mentors were a joke. Most of them were not experts in real estate and did not [have] experience in the real estate techniques they were teaching,â€ Nichols said. â€œThey were unqualified people posing as Donald Trumpâ€™s â€right-hand men.â€™ They were teaching methods that were unethical, and they had little to no experience flipping properties or doing real estate deals. It was a fa§ade, a total lie.â€

Other rebuttals suggested by training materials likewise appealed to customersâ€™ insecurities while invoking Trumpâ€™s success. What if customers say they want to invest that $35,000 fee in property instead? â€œYou have no specialized knowledge or system to fall back on,â€ the playbook suggests. â€œMr. Trump doesnâ€™t use his own money to invest and look at his success!â€ Or a customer might say they have enough information to invest on their own. â€œBut what weâ€™re offering is a proven system from Mr. Trump to help you close multiple deals every month, with a millionaire mentor by your side making sure you donâ€™t make any mistakes, and creating the most amount of profit per deal,â€ the playbook counters. â€œLet me ask you a question; are you capable of making one or two mistakes on your own?â€ (In parentheses, the salesperson is instructed to smile while saying these lines.) The scripts and rebuttals emphasize the risk of not taking part in the program while evading its inherent risks. What if the customer doesnâ€™t want to go into debt by purchasing the seminars? â€œEvery single company goes into debt when they are first starting out, EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS!â€ the playbook says. â€œThe profits pay off the debt and before you know it, your new real-estate business will start making amazing returns.â€ Corinne Sommer, the former manager of Trump Universityâ€™s events departments, recalled how instructors in the second-level seminars, which cost roughly $1,500 to attend, would ask customers to call their credit-card companies to triple or quadruple their credit limit and max out their credit cards for real-estate investments.

â€œWhile Trump Universityâ€™s advertisements claimed it wanted to help consumers make money in real estate, in fact, based upon my experience, I believe that Trump University was only interested in selling every person the most expensive seminars they could possibly buy on credit,â€ Sommer testified. â€œI recall that some consumers had showed up who were homeless and could not afford the seminars, yet I overheard Trump University representatives telling them, â€itâ€™s ok; just max out your credit card.â€™â€ Not everyone proved unhappy; the filings also included testimony from many graduates of Trump University who professed themselves delighted with the decisions theyâ€™d made. Trump University came to an end five years before Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign officially began. But both products rely on a similar three-part strategy. The first part is an emphasis on insecurity. For Trump Universityâ€™s sales team, that meant focusing on the customerâ€™s personal financial shortcomings when closing a deal. For Trump himself, it manifests as stump speeches bemoaning the decline in American manufacturing, the peril of illegal immigration, the rise of China and ISIS, and how â€œwe donâ€™t win anymore.â€ These insecurities may or may not be grounded in reality. But the solutions to them often arenâ€™t. Trump University promised an easy path to wealth and success in the real-estate market just as the housing bubble was about to burst. (â€œLetâ€™s get you enrolled today so you can start building a real estate empire,â€ reads one suggested line from the playbook.) Trumpâ€™s campaign solutions are even more grandiose, ranging from a giant wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to a military so large and strong â€œweâ€™ll never have to use it.â€ The third part is Trump, or, perhaps more accurately, Trumpâ€™s personal brand, in all its coiffed and gilded glory. Decades of effort invested in making a surname synonymous with business acumen and extravagant wealth imbued Trump University with a legitimacy it could not otherwise acquire. Trump himself also relies on this on the campaign trailâ€”not the name recognition, but its association with â€œwinning.â€ For both Trump and Trump University, the goal is for prospective customers and potential voters alike to think his success can rub off on them, too. But that payoff may never come. â€œI do not believe that Trump University taught Donald Trumpâ€™s investing â€secrets,â€™â€ one former Trump employee testified. â€œDonald Trump came from a wealthy family and had resources at his disposal to purchase real estateâ€”that is the secretâ€”one the average consumer could not replicate.â€
