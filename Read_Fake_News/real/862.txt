Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz says Bernie Sanders added fuel to the fire that raged at last weekendâ€™s chaotic Democratic convention in Nevada, criticizing him for choosing to denounce party leaders before condemning violence in a written statement.

â€œShe says that Bernieâ€™s adding fuel to the fire? She just added fuel to the fire,â€ Jones said Tuesday, shortly after Wasserman Schultz said in an interview that Sandersâ€™s response to reports of a scuffle and threatening behavior by some of his supporters was â€œanything but acceptable.â€

The problem that we have right now is that there has been this concern on the part of Bernieâ€™s people that the DNC has been on Hillaryâ€™s side. ... First of all, Bernie did say, in his statement, that heâ€™s against the violence. Also, if you want to talk about violence, only one personâ€™s been arrested â€” it was a Hillary Clinton supporter, Wendell Pierce, arrested for assaulting a Sanders supporter. So, if youâ€™re going to come out and youâ€™re going to talk about violence and youâ€™re the DNC chair, you have to be fair about it. I donâ€™t think she was fair. I think she actually made it worse now. We have to pull these people together. That did not happen.

MSNBCâ€™s Mika Brzezinski went farther than Jones on Wednesday, calling for Wasserman Schultz to resign.

â€œThis has been very poorly handled from the start,â€ Brzezinski said. â€œIt has been unfair, and they havenâ€™t taken him seriously, and it starts, quite frankly, with the person that we just heard speaking [Wasserman Schultz]. It just does. ... She should step down. She should step down.â€

Fellow MSNBC host Chris Hayes, meanwhile, said Tuesday that itâ€™s clear that Wasserman Schultzâ€™s fingers are on the scale.

â€œIt is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent that there are things that can be done institutionally and marginally to facilitate that outcome, they are being done,â€ Hayes said.

As the Democratic presidential nominating contest drags on â€” with the Republican race already over â€” left-leaning pundits are increasingly pinning the blame for disunity on the party boss, instead of the underdog candidate who refuses to drop out. Sanders might be stubborn, but Wasserman Schultz drove him to it by favoring Clinton from the start. Or so the argument goes. And the situation in Nevada seems to have turned up the heat on some long-simmering tensions.

Top complaints include briefly suspending the Sanders campaignâ€™s access to a voter database and scheduling half as many primary debates (six) as the Republicans did â€” and putting half of those events on weekend nights, allegedly to minimize exposure and insulate the front-runner.

The database suspension was a penalty imposed after Sanders acknowledged that a staffer improperly exploited a software glitch that allowed him to view confidential voter information held by the Clinton campaign. The DNC eventually sanctioned four additional debates, though only three have been held and there is no date for the fourth.

The left side of the media has been criticizing Wasserman Schultzâ€™s handling of the primary process for a while. â€œFire Debbie Wasserman Schultz,â€ blared a to-the-point headline on the Huffington Post in December. On the same day, Slate declared that â€œDebbie Wasserman Schultz is acting just like the villain Bernie Sanders says she is."â€

More recently, Esquireâ€™s Charles P. Pierce called for Wasserman Schultzâ€™s ouster in March (though for reasons unrelated to the 2016 primary),

The liberal press isn't alone in its frustration. As The Fixâ€™s Janell Ross wrote in January, â€œWasserman Schultzâ€™s list of enemies just keeps growingâ€ â€” a list that includes some fellow Democrats and progressive advocacy groups. The consternation dates to at least 2014, when Politicoâ€™s Edward-Isaac Dovere wrote a lengthy piece about unhappiness with her performance.

As of Thursday morning, a MoveOn.org petition calling for Wasserman Schultz to resign had 76,146 digital signatures. A similar petition at Change.org had 60,525. Another on CREDO Actionâ€™s website had 86,291.

Itâ€™s clear that Wasserman Schultz is in a difficult spot â€” one she almost certainly didnâ€™t anticipate at the beginning of the election season. Sanders made the Democratic race far more competitive than anyone imagined. But as he delays the inevitable, Wasserman Schultz finds that she, too, is being cast as a divisive figure by the media.

On top of it all, the perception could be virtually impossible to shake. While Sanders will ultimately be judged by the extent to which he rallies supporters to Clinton in the general election, Wasserman Schultz is already being judged by moves she made early in the primary season that canâ€™t be reversed. Sanders backers might always believe their candidate didnâ€™t get a fair shake, and those accusations will probably be part of Wasserman Schultzâ€™s media narrative for a long time to come.
