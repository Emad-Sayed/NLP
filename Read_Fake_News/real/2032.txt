Barack Obamaâ€™s announcement on Friday that American special forces will take a more active role in the war in Syria is for many critics of his foreign policy a confirmation that the US has inched deeper into a chaotic conflict.

Itâ€™s also an opportunity for presidential candidates to both praise and denounce him. And most Republican and Democratic presidential candidates propose doing even more than the raids that Obama has authorized, which skeptics call â€œmission creepâ€. The war pits the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, against various rebels and the jihadi group Islamic State, and now involves the US, Russia, Iran, Gulf states, Turkey, the Kurds and Iraq. Hereâ€™s how foreign policy might look under the ideas of potential presidents.

Nearly all the candidates of both parties have called for a no-fly zone over Syria, arguing that denying Assadâ€™s air force will better protect civilians and rebels from bombing runs.

â€œA superpower can impose a no-fly zone if it decides it wants to,â€ said Stephen Biddle, a professor of international affairs at George Washington University. â€œBut the problems are itâ€™s very expensive, no one is willing to pay the price, and these days there are serious risks of escalation.â€

A no-fly zone would require far more airstrikes on airfields and anti-aircraft batteries, for instance, putting American pilots in danger against Syrian missiles and jets. Russiaâ€™s entry into the war further complicates the proposal, increasing the risk of shooting down Russian aircraft bombing rebels.

And while a future president could warn Vladimir Putin to fly strikes at his own peril, the US stands to lose more should Putin simply continue strikes. An American presidentâ€™s choice would then be to stand down or risk a wider, far more dangerous war â€“ and political disaster at home â€“ by firing on Russian pilots.

Nor would a no-fly zone offer certain protection to civilians or rebels whom an American president finds acceptable. Most of the warâ€™s dead â€“ civilian or combatant â€“ have not been killed from the air but on the ground, by bullets, mortars and artillery shells, according to the Violations Documentation Center.

The statistics suggest a no-fly zone would not do much to staunch the bleeding of civilians or any friendly rebels. In contrast, Russiaâ€™s strategy of indiscriminate bombing boosts Assadâ€™s much more limited aims, which do not take civilian casualties into account.

Only Republican Rand Paul and Democrats Martin Oâ€™Malley and Bernie Sanders oppose a no-fly zone.

Billionaire Donald Trump has maintained that â€œsafe zonesâ€ on the ground in Syria and Iraq would help end the war and solve the refugee crisis, and said that Turkey and the Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar should lead the effort with US help.

But while a ground campaign could defend civilians from the deadliest threats, it would also entail all the dangers of mission creep and the painstaking logistics of a war effort. One American has already died in a raid on an Isis facility, and a Russian soldier died in Syria last week.

â€œTo keep it safe would require fighting,â€ the defense secretary, Ash Carter, told Congress on Tuesday. â€œYou need to think in each case â€¦ whoâ€™s in, who is kept out and how the enforcement of it is done.â€

Any campaign would probably need snipers, radar and recon teams, artillery and special operations teams â€“ if not full infantry battalions, Micah Zenko, a senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations, has noted in Foreign Policy.

â€œThe types of interventions that proponents have endorsed for Syria are often based on deep misunderstandings of how US force was used on behalf of humanitarian missions in the past,â€ Zenko wrote. â€œProposals that consciously ignore or downplay the amount and type of force needed to protect civilians are just wishful thinking.â€

Biddle agreed, adding that another problem is that safe zones offer cover to both civilians and combatants.

â€œSay you set up a safe zone along the Turkish-Syrian border, and lo and behold guerrillas start operating within it, and the government starts firing artillery into it. What do you do then? Silence the artillery by expanding your perimeter? Push the perimeter until itâ€™s all of Syria?â€

He also noted the problem of policing â€“ for instance, the dilemma of a suspected rebel whose family vouches for the personâ€™s innocence.

â€œYou donâ€™t have to walk very far down the thought experiment to end up with all sorts of problems and ambiguities,â€ Biddle said.

Senator Marco Rubio is the most vocal supporter of embedding special forces with rebel and Kurdish ground troops.

Most of the candidates support arms for rebels, though few have specified which groups they find acceptable and how they would vet them â€“ the same problems that have slowed Pentagon efforts in the last two years.

More problematically, most of the Syrian rebels eager for weapons and aid are not interested in a concerted fight against Isis. â€œWhile there are tens of thousands of rebels willing to receive training and equipment to go after the Assad regime, few are willing to fight the Islamic State,â€ Zenko wrote earlier this year.

Arming anti-Assad rebels may suit US interests, but it would also pit the US against Russia and Iran in a proxy war. Even regional allies disagree with American priorities about Isis, Biddle noted, which is why Turkey continues to bomb Kurds and Saudi Arabia and the UAE arm groups around the region, most notably in Syria but also in the ruins of Yemen. These same conflicted interests make it unlikely that the nations would ever band together to form their own â€œsafe zoneâ€.

â€œThey all have bigger fish to fry,â€ he said. â€œWeâ€™re the biggest, but weâ€™re the only one who thinks Isil is the threat to be resolved first.â€

Although Kurdish fighters have proven the most reliable allies for US ground offensives, Turkish warplanes have increased bombing sorties against Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq, meaning increased arms for the Kurds could fuel a war between two American allies on yet another border.

Arming Kurdish fighters could also lead to the US supplying groups that it has named terrorists, if it hasnâ€™t inadvertently done so already. In October Amnesty International accused the Kurdish group YPG of human rights violations.

Rubio, Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham have spoken strongly in favor of arming Syrian rebel groups and Kurds, Ted Cruz has called for directly arming the Kurds, Hillary Clinton urged arms for rebels and Kurds while she was secretary of state, and even Oâ€™Malley has said the US should â€œprobablyâ€ arm the fighters.

All candidates except Senator Rand Paul have said they support Obamaâ€™s decision to extend the US military presence in Afghanistan to 2017, though a handful say they only do so out of deference to the generalsâ€™ advice.

But the presence of 5,500 to 10,000 troops, as the president and candidates prescribe, would have little effect on the war against the Taliban, experts said. Most said a steady run of airstrikes had prevented the Taliban from massing, and that the end of â€œcombat operationsâ€ â€“ resulting in a lull in airstrikes â€“ had given the militants opportunity to retake cities and regroup.

The spread of American troops at four airbases around Afghanistan and continued airstrikes â€“ including one that bombed a hospital â€“ suggests Obama plans to let generals use as much airpower as possible to support Afghan forces. But neither he nor any candidate has shown any appetite for a major reinforcement.

Barring dramatic changes to Barack Obamaâ€™s plans and the politics of the Middle East, 2017 will begin with 5,500 troops across Afghanistan and a number of special forces teams operating in Syria and Iraq.

Paul, Trump and Cruz have all offered variations on a plan that could see US forces withdraw from the region, ceding a lead military role to Russia and Iran but continuing airstrikes against Isis. But while staying out of foreign conflicts has appeal at home to Democrats and Republicans alike â€“ and arguably supports US interests â€“ â€œit still sacrifices interests that are real, even if theyâ€™re limited,â€ Biddle said.

â€œThereâ€™s the prospective future terrorist threat of an ungoverned region, the risk of a war if that metastasizes and spreads,â€ he said. â€œIf you wash your hands of it, youâ€™re running a social science experiment to sit back and see how many of these bad things unfold. Thatâ€™s a really bad choice for a person that has the power to make a difference.â€

Not least on the minds of the president or any would-be commander in chief, he added, was that to do nothing â€œhands the opposition a bunch of really obvious talking pointsâ€.
