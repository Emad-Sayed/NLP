Just days after Donald Trump showed faint interest in building broad-based Republican support and House Speaker Paul Ryan seemed averse to his partyâ€™s nominee-in-waiting, the two have met and now thereâ€™s talk of GOP â€œunity.â€

Why this about face after a couple of hours of face time in the nationâ€™s capital? Because Trump and Ryan are numbers guys (one with real estate, the other with federal budgets).

And these numbers stand out: 93, 32 and 5.

In 2012, Mitt Romney reaped 93 percent of the GOP vote. However, Republicans constituted only 32 percent of the national electorate. Trump doesnâ€™t win in November without a better quantitative showing. And Ryan could be back in the minority should Trump lose by more than 5 percent in states with vulnerable Republican congressman.

Simply put, itâ€™s in both Trump's and Ryanâ€™s short-term interests to be cordial at a minimum, even while maintaining serious policy differences that arenâ€™t going away anytime soon despite this first attempt a little d©tente (youâ€™ll know itâ€™s a bromance if the hard-exercising Ryan agrees to a round of golf; or Trump goes bow-hunting in Wisconsin).

Despite the hoopla surrounding this meeting, it doesnâ€™t ensure Republican â€œpeace in our time,â€ as a failed British prime minister famously said. Though Trump has on occasion shown signs of a willingness to alter stances (most notably, the mass deportation of illegal immigrants), publicly acceding to a congressional agenda undermines Trumpâ€™s brand of anti-establishment and anti-status-quo thinking that warned him the partyâ€™s nomination. Just as Ryan wonâ€™t publicly give up on his conservative principles â€“ most notably: entitlement reform (which Iâ€™d guess is the closed-door promise heâ€™s seeking from Trump in exchange for a public endorsement).

Then again, would you rather be Donald Trump, trying to strike a deal with a practical fellow like Paul Ryan, or Hillary Clinton trying to come to terms with an irascible 74-year-old socialist?

The more primaries he wins, the more Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders buys into the notion that heâ€™s on a mission. Such self-deluded candidates donâ€™t retire from the field gracefully. Good luck finding unity there. And good luck getting it â€” without having to further to socialist vision that work only in those parts of America where Whole Foods and marijuana dispensaries are plentiful.

W.C. Fields had it wrong: Iâ€™d rather not be in Philadelphia, where the Democrats will convene for their national convention and try to settle their differences.
