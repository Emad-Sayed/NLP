Donald Trump would not commit Wednesday night to accepting the results of the presidential election if he loses on Nov. 8, in a striking moment during his final debate with Hillary Clinton that underscored the deepening tensions in the race â€“ as the bitter rivals defined the choice for voters on an array of issues not three weeks from Election Day.

The debate in Las Vegas, moderated by Fox Newsâ€™ Chris Wallace, started with a measured discussion on policy disputes ranging from gun rights to abortion to immigration. But it ended with the candidates hurling a grab-bag of accusations and insults at each other.

Trump called Clinton a â€œnasty woman.â€ Clinton called Trump the â€œmost dangerousâ€ person to run for president in modern history.

The most pointed moment came when Trump â€“ who for weeks has warned of a â€œriggedâ€ election â€“ was asked whether he will commit to accept the results of the election.

â€œI will look at it at the time,â€ Trump said, citing his concerns about voter registration fraud, a â€œcorrupt mediaâ€ and an opponent he claimed â€œshouldnâ€™t be allowed to runâ€ because she committed a â€œvery serious crimeâ€ with her emails.

Pressed again whether heâ€™s prepared to concede if he loses, Trump again said: â€œI will tell you at the time. Iâ€™ll keep you in suspense.â€

â€œThat is not the way our democracy works,â€ she said. â€œHe is denigrating, heâ€™s talking down our democracy and I for one am appalled.â€

Trump responded by calling the Justice Departmentâ€™s handling of her email probe â€œdisgraceful.â€

The exchange was among many contentious moments at Wednesdayâ€™s debate, which covered several issues including the national debt that have gotten little attention in the race so far â€“ but flared with arguments between the candidates over WikiLeaks, over Russia, over the Clinton Foundation and over womenâ€™s allegations of groping against Trump.

Through the thicket of accusations and personal animus â€“ they never shook hands on stage â€“ the candidates tried generally to mount a closing debate-stage argument about experience.

â€œFor 30 years, youâ€™ve been in a position to help. â€¦ The problem is you talk, but you donâ€™t get anything done, Hillary,â€ Trump said. â€œIf you become president, this country is going to be in some mess, believe me.â€

Clinton countered by contrasting some of her experiences against Trumpâ€™s. She said when she was monitoring the Usama bin Laden raid in the Situation Room, â€œHe was hosting â€The Celebrity Apprentice.â€™â€

â€œIâ€™m happy to compare my 30 years of experience â€¦ with your 30 years, and I will let the American people make that decision,â€ Clinton said.

Trump, meanwhile, again disputed the multiple allegations of groping that women have leveled against him since the candidatesâ€™ last encounter. He also said he thinks the Clinton campaign is behind the claims, charging, â€œThey either want fame or her campaign did it.â€

Clinton said, â€œDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.â€ Trump repeated that â€œnobody has more respect for womenâ€ than him.

Trump then shifted to blast the Clinton Foundation as a â€œcriminal enterprise.â€ He pointed to donations from countries like Saudi Arabia to question Clintonâ€™s commitment to womenâ€™s rights. He asked her if she would return money from countries that treat certain â€œgroups of people horribly,â€ which she did not answer directly.

The candidatesâ€™ third and final debate now sets a bitter tone for the homestretch of the 2016 presidential campaign â€“ a race that already stands out as arguably the most personal, caustic and unpredictable White House battle in modern politics.

Trump, slipping in the polls amid various campaign controversies, said at the last debate that Clinton should be in jail. Clinton has blasted Trump all along as temperamentally unfit for office.

Since the second debate, numerous women have come forward to accuse Trump of groping them, allegations he denies. WikiLeaks also has embarrassed the Clinton campaign by releasing thousands of hacked emails purportedly from her campaign chairmanâ€™s account. FBI files alleging a State Department official sought a â€œquid pro quoâ€ to alter the classification on a Clinton server email added to the campaignâ€™s â€“ and Obama administrationâ€™s â€“ woes.

The WikiLeaks controversy came up Wednesday night when Clinton asked if Trump would â€œcondemnâ€ Russian espionage. He denied knowing Vladimir Putin but said the issue is the Russian president has â€œno respectâ€ for her.

â€œThatâ€™s because heâ€™d rather have a puppet,â€ Clinton shot back.

Trump later said he condemns any interference by Russia in the election.

The candidates also sparred over gun rights, with the Republican nominee charging that the Second Amendment is â€œunder absolute siegeâ€ and would be eroded if his opponent wins.

â€œWe will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what we have nowâ€ if Clinton wins, Trump said.

The Democratic nominee countered, â€œI support the Second Amendment.â€

In a graphic exchange, Trump said Clintonâ€™s position on abortion is nearing a point where one could â€œrip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month.â€ Clinton accused him of â€œscare rhetoric.â€

They also clashed on immigration, with Trump saying they need to deport â€œdrug lordsâ€ and deal with â€œbad hombresâ€ in the country. Clinton said violent offenders should be deported but then mocked Trump for not pushing his controversial border wall proposal during his high-profile meeting with the Mexican president. â€œHe choked,â€ she said.

Trump said Clinton â€œwanted a wallâ€ when she voted for an immigration overhaul a decade ago â€“ and now wants â€œopen borders,â€ which she denied.

To date, the mounting controversies facing both campaigns have appeared to hurt Trump more than Clinton, who gradually has expanded her lead over the GOP nominee in recent polls.

A Fox News national poll released on the eve of the Las Vegas debate showed Clinton with a 6-point, 45-39 percent lead over Trump in a match-up that includes Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

Trump, in the final three weeks, is thought to be zeroing in on several key battlegrounds including Florida, Ohio and North Carolina â€“ but the polls suggest his path to the presidency remains narrow, as even once-reliably red states like Texas are being contested by the Clinton campaign.
