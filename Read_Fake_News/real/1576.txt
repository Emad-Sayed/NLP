Republicans have said for years the first lady hates America, but they defend her words when they come out of Mrs. Trumpâ€™s mouth .

An entire section of Trumpâ€™s speechâ€”focused on the values she and her husband shareâ€”appears to be lifted directly from Obamaâ€™s comments on the same subject eight years ago. Back then, Republicans claimed Michelle Obama wasnâ€™t â€œproudâ€ of her country; now Republicans defend her words when theyâ€™re coming out of Melaniaâ€™s mouth.

The controversy capped a chaotic first day of the Republican National Convention. Monday started with Trumpâ€™s campaign attacking popular Ohio governor and former presidential challenger John Kasich as an â€œembarrassmentâ€ for not attending the convention in Cleveland. By afternoon, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was rallying people outsideâ€”until he was interrupted by a popular comedian asking the fringe radio host to â€œhave sex with my wife.â€

Not long after, a fight erupted on the convention floor, with anti-Trump delegates demanding a roll call vote before the RNC got underway. At another point, Rep. Steve King was on MSNBC suggesting white people are better than any â€œsub-groups.â€ By the evening, speaker after speaker recalled in the most minute detail the attacks on the U.S. compound in Benghazi.

â€œFrom a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise; that you treat people with respect,â€ Melania said [emphasis added]. â€œThey taught and showed me values and morals in their daily life. That is a lesson that I continue to pass along to our son, and we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.â€

â€œBarack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say youâ€™re going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you donâ€™t agree with them. And Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generation. Because we want our childrenâ€”and all children in this nationâ€”to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.â€

Before the convention, Team Trump told CNN that Melania spent five to six weeks working on the speech. She told Matt Lauer on Monday afternoon that she had â€œas little help as possibleâ€ writing it.

â€œIn writing her beautiful speech, Melaniaâ€™s team of writers took notes on her lifeâ€™s inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking,â€ spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement late Monday. â€œMelaniaâ€™s immigrant experience and love for America shone through in her speech, which made it such a success.â€

â€œThis is once again an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton sheâ€™ll... take her down,â€ campaign manager Paul Manafort told CNN. â€œItâ€™s not going to work.â€
