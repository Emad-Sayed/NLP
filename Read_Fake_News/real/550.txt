Hillary Clinton plans to attack Donald Trumpâ€™s national security plans in a major speech on foreign policy on Thursday, as the frontrunners campaign in California ahead of the stateâ€™s primary next week.

Clintonâ€™s campaign said the speech, which will be delivered in San Diego at 11.30am local time, will draw a clear line between the former secretary of stateâ€™s plans and those outlined by Trump, which include having Mexico pay for a border wall that its president, Enrique Pe±a Nieto, said his country would not support, and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the US.

Clinton campaign senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan said the speech would outline why Trump was â€œfundamentally unfitâ€ to be president.

â€œAnd you will hear in her speech a confidence in America and our capacity to overcome the challenges we face while staying true to our values â€“ a strong contrast to Donald Trumpâ€™s incessant trash-talking of America,â€ Sullivan said.

Clintonâ€™s campaign has said it expects to secure the final delegates she needs to officially become the partyâ€™s nominee after the California and New Jersey primaries on 7 June.

â€œShe will rebuke a litany of dangerous policies that Trump has espoused,â€ Sullivan said, â€œranging from nuclear proliferation to endorsing war crimes, from denouncing Nato to banning Muslims.

â€œBut Clintonâ€™s critique will go beyond specific policies and sheâ€™ll make clear that the choice in this election goes beyond partisanship. Donald Trump is unlike any presidential nominee weâ€™ve seen in modern times and he is fundamentally unfit for the job.â€

Clintonâ€™s campaign has steered its plan of attack towards Trump while fending off the other remaining Democratic hopeful, Bernie Sanders.

Clinton has 2,312 delegates, including 543 super delegates, to Sandersâ€™ 1,545 delegates, including 44 super delegates, according to the Associated Press.

Clinton did not mention Sanders on in a Wednesday night speech at Rutgers University in New Jersey, in which she called Trump a â€œfraudâ€.

Her remarks focused on newly released documents that show Trumpâ€™s defunct business training program, Trump University, encouraged staff to target prospective studentsâ€™ financial weakness in order to move them to enroll in expensive courses.

â€œThis is just more evidence that Donald Trump himself is a fraud,â€ she said. â€œHe is trying to scam America the way he scammed all those people at Trump U.â€

The same day, Barack Obama delivered a hit on Trump in a speech in Elkhart, Indiana. The US president told his audience a Trump presidency would increase the risk of a financial crisis.

â€œThe Republican nominee for president has already said heâ€™d dismantle all these rules that we passed,â€ Obama said, referring to Wall Street reform. â€œThat is crazy.â€

Trump is also ampaigning in California. Speaking in Sacramento on Wednesday night, he responded to Obamaâ€™s claims from earlier in the day by calling the president â€œa total lightweightâ€.
