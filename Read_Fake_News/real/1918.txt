Jeb Bush previewed the ideas at the heart of his likely presidential campaign, delivering a sweeping address here Friday about the economy, foreign affairs and energy exploration, and challenging the country to question â€œevery aspect of how government works.â€

In his first major speech since stepping into the 2016 presidential sweepstakes in December, the Republican former Florida governor spoke confidently and in significant detail about the broad range of issues beginning to shape the campaign for the White House. Bush signaled he would offer the country the â€œadult conversationsâ€ he said are lacking in Washington and would focus on people who have been left out of the economic revival.

â€œSixty percent of Americans believe that weâ€™re still in a recession,â€ Bush said. â€œTheyâ€™re not dumb. Itâ€™s because they are in a recession. Theyâ€™re frustrated, and they see a small portion of the population on the economyâ€™s up escalator. Portfolios are strong, but paychecks are weak. Millions of Americans want to move forward in their lives â€” they want to rise â€” but theyâ€™re losing hope.â€

Bush was sharply critical of Washington â€” not only of President Obama but also of the Republican-controlled Congress â€” saying there were too many â€œacademic and political hacksâ€ with â€œhard-core ideologyâ€ who are running the country without making progress.

â€œTheyâ€™re basically Maytag repairmen,â€ he said. â€œNothing gets done.â€ Bush added, â€œIt is time to challenge every aspect of how government works â€” how it taxes, how it regulates, how it spends â€” to open up economic opportunity for all.â€

Bush delivered Fridayâ€™s keynote address to the National Automobile Dealers Associationâ€™s annual convention in San Francisco, one of his final paid speaking appearances before he turns his attention fully to the 2016 campaign.

Bush â€” who has been on an ambitious, national tour to raise money for Right to Rise PAC, his leadership political action committee â€” was careful to say he was only â€œseriously considering the possibility of running.â€ He told the crowd of 4,000 auto dealers and industry executives, â€œYour checkbook, by the way, is very safe here.â€

But Bush used the opportunity to signal the kind of campaign he intends to run. His message contrasted starkly with the rhetoric expected from some other hopefuls who are gathering in Iowa this weekend for a political festival hosted by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), an anti-immigration reform firebrand.

Bush drew loud and sustained applause when he called for immigration reform that would provide a path to legalized status for undocumented immigrants living in the United States.

â€œWe have a history of allowing people to come in legally to embrace our values and pursue their dreams in a way that creates prosperity for all of us,â€ Bush said. â€œNo country can do this like America. Our national identity is not based on race or some kind of exclusionary belief. Historically, the unwritten contract has been, come legally to our country, embrace our values, learn English, work and you can be as American as anyone else.â€

In an subtle swipe at other GOP leaders and potential rivals who rally the conservative base with hot tirades about Obamaâ€™s overreach, Bush said the Republican Party will win back the White House only if it offers an optimistic message. â€œHope and a positive agenda wins out over anger and reaction every day of the week,â€ he said.

Bushâ€™s called for simplification of the tax code, including lowering rates and â€œeliminating as many loopholes as possible.â€ He also called for more energy exploration. Approving construction of the Keystone XL pipeline was â€œa no-brainer,â€ he said, as is support for horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking.

â€œItâ€™s not cool here in San Francisco to talk about this,â€ he joked. But, â€œItâ€™s cool in places like North Dakota and West Texas and South Texas. Itâ€™s cool because it creates significant economic activity.â€

In his appearance here, Bush did not shy away from his place in a dynastic political family. The bio video that played before he spoke was heavy on references to his father, former president George H.W. Bush, and brother, former president George W. Bush. Jeb Bush cited both in his remarks, saying his dad was a model for leadership, especially on foreign policy, and noting that his brother had become a rather fine painter. â€œWho wouldâ€™ve thunk it?â€ he said.

Bush is not alone among likely 2016 presidential candidates on the paid speaking circuit. Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton has been delivering speeches and making other appearances for pay since stepping down as secretary of state in 2013.

Clinton was a keynote speaker at last yearâ€™s auto dealers convention, in New Orleans, where she disclosed that she had not driven a car in nearly 20 years. â€œThe last time I actually drove a car myself was 1996,â€ she said. Jokingly, she added: â€œI remember it very well. Unfortunately, so does the Secret Service, which is why I havenâ€™t driven since then.â€

Bush made an indirect reference to Clintonâ€™s remark. During the question-and-answer session, when the associationâ€™s chairman asked Bush his favorite kind of car, Bush said he just bought a Ford Fusion. â€œFor the record, I do drive,â€ he said, adding that he plans to return to the dealership for a two-hour tutorial on the Fusionâ€™s technology.

Bush was asked about his Thursday meeting in Utah with Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee who also is exploring a 2016 run. The two men, each a favorite of the party establishment, are on a collision course, but Bush said they mostly avoided talk about the campaign.

â€œWe talked about the Patriots,â€ Bush said. â€œWe talked a little bit about politics, not as much as you might imagine. We talked about the future of the country. We talked about the need for a more engaged foreign policy..â€‰.â€‰.The awkward side of this, about running and such, we put aside.â€

Answering questions on stage, Bush opened a window on his personal life. He said he loves Sundays â€” â€œItâ€™s Sunday fun dayâ€ â€” because he doesnâ€™t work. â€œI play golf really fast so I can have breakfast really fast so I can go to Mass slower â€” canâ€™t ask the priest to accelerate that. I probably would if I could.â€

He called himself â€œan introvert,â€ saying he would â€œrather read a book than go out and get in a conga line.â€

â€œIntroverts actually are grinders,â€ Bush said. â€œThey identify a problem by and large, and then they overcome it. But I learned that in order to make your case or in order to serve or in order to advance a cause, you have to connect with people, and you canâ€™t connect with people if youâ€™re back in the corner reading a book.â€
