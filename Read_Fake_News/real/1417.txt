Top Republicans joined with President Obama and other Democrats Tuesday in sharply condemning Donald Trumpâ€™s reaction to the nightclub massacre in Orlando, decrying his anti-Muslim rhetoric and his questioning of Obamaâ€™s allegiances as divisive and out of step with Americaâ€™s values.

Trump â€” who just a week ago signaled an intent to snap his campaign into a more measured tone for the general election â€” showed no sign of backing down from his suggestions that Obama was somehow connected to or sympathetic with terrorists, telling the Associated Press that the president â€œcontinues to prioritize our enemyâ€ over Americans.

In separate appearances, both Obama and his potential successor, likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, blasted Trumpâ€™s proposal to ban foreign Muslims from the United States as dangerous and contrary to the nationâ€™s traditions.

A visibly angry Obama also dismissed Trumpâ€™s repeated demands for him to use the term â€œradical Islamâ€ when speaking about the Orlando shootings and other attacks. â€œCalling a threat by a different name does not make it go away,â€ Obama said. â€œThis is a political distraction.â€

Clinton described Trumpâ€™s response to Orlando as rife with â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ and â€œpathological self-congratulations.â€

The remarkable bipartisan outcry over Trumpâ€™s positions â€” coming at a moment of national mourning after the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history â€” set off a new wave of alarm within the GOP over whether the real estate mogulâ€™s promised pivot to the general election would ever materialize. The rift also highlighted the enduring tensions between establishment figures who want to be more inclusive and the bulk of the party, which backs Trumpâ€™s proposed Muslim ban and has rallied around him as the presumptive nominee.

Some of Trumpâ€™s most ardent backers defended his response to the Orlando attack, saying drastic measures were needed to keep the nation safe. But most Republicans on Capitol Hill tried to distance themselves from Trumpâ€™s comments following the terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando that killed at least 49 people. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) refused to respond to questions about Trump at his weekly news conference.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) denounced Trump for trying to rally support for his anti-Muslim policies, while others castigated Trump for the accusations he has lobbed at Obama.

â€œI do not think a Muslim ban is in our countryâ€™s interest,â€ Ryan told reporters. â€œI do not think it is reflective of our principles, not just as a party but as a country.â€ He called for â€œa security test, not a religious testâ€ for immigrants.

In a speech Monday, Trump had reiterated his calls for such a ban and expanded its potential reach to include any country with â€œa historyâ€ of terrorism against the United States and its allies. He blamed the Orlando attack â€” which authorities say was carried out by a man born in America to Afghan parents â€” in part on a system that â€œallowed his family to come here.â€

At a rally Tuesday night in Greensboro, N.C., Trump attacked Obama for criticizing him and defended barring foreign Muslims.

â€œOnce again weâ€™ve seen that political correctness is deadly,â€ Trump said.

â€œAnd just so you understand: I have many Muslim friends,â€ he added at one point. â€œThere doesnâ€™t seem to be assimilation. We donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on.â€

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who has praised Trump at times for his willingness to shake up politics and recently met with the mogul, expressed serious unease Tuesday with how Trump responded to a national tragedy.

â€œTraditionally, it is a time when people rally around our country, and itâ€™s obviously not whatâ€™s occurred, and itâ€™s very disappointing,â€ Corker said.

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a leading national security hawk, said he had â€œrun out of adjectivesâ€ for Trump. â€œI donâ€™t think he has the judgment or the temperament, the experience to deal with what we are facing,â€ said Graham, who does not currently support the mogul.

Graham, like other Republicans, took issue with Trumpâ€™s apparent suggestions in Monday interviews that Obama may identify with the radical Muslim terrorists. Obama â€œeither is not tough, not smart, or heâ€™s got something else in mind,â€ Trump told Fox News.

Trump expanded on that Tuesday, saying in an emailed response to questions from the Associated Press: â€œPresident Obama claims to know our enemy, and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies and, for that matter, the American people.â€

Graham said that Trump â€œseems to be suggesting that the president is one of â€them.â€™ I find that highly offensive. I find that whole line of reasoning way off base. My problems with President Obama are his policy choices.â€

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who faces a challenging reelection bid, also called Trumpâ€™s insinuations about Obama â€œoffensive.â€

Speaking after meeting with his National Security Council, Obama dismissed Trumpâ€™s many calls for him to change the way he talks about terrorism.

â€œThatâ€™s the key, they tell us. We canâ€™t get ISIL unless we call them â€radical Islamists,â€™ â€ Obama said, referring to the Islamic State militant group. â€œWhat exactly would using this label accomplish? What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to trying to kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is: none of the above.â€

At a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Clinton excoriated Trump and challenged Republicans to repudiate him. Clinton said Trump failed to demonstrate an ability to deliver a â€œcalm, collected and dignified responseâ€ to the Orlando attack.

â€œInstead, yesterday morning, just one day after the massacre, he went on TV and suggested that President Obama is on the side of the terrorists,â€ Clinton said. â€œJust think about that. Even in a time of divided politics, this is way beyond anything that should be said by someone running for president.â€

Trump has also said Obama should â€œresignâ€ because of his refusal to utter the words â€œradical Islamic terrorism.â€ But one of the mogulâ€™s top backers on Capitol Hill said Trump doesnâ€™t expect that to happen.

â€œWhat I think Trumpâ€™s saying is: You need to get in the game and start leading, or get out of here,â€ said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.). â€œThatâ€™s just his way of expressing it. And I think people understood that. He doesnâ€™t expect President Obama to resign, but heâ€™s saying you canâ€™t do this job effectively if you donâ€™t understand the nature of the threat we face.â€

Sessions said there was no discussion at a 90-minute Senate GOP lunch of Trump specifically; instead it focused on terrorism.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), an Air National Guard major and leading House GOP voice on national security issues, broke sharply with Trump.

â€œI guess I appreciate Mr. Trumpâ€™s fieriness in talking about it, but you donâ€™t do it by alienating the very people that we need, and those are moderate Muslims,â€ he said. â€œWe have to use the folks that frankly are not radicalized, which is the vast majority of Muslims, to win this war.â€

Nationally, 64 percent of Republican voters said in a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll that they approve of Trumpâ€™s Muslim ban â€” as did 45 percent of independents â€” while 26 percent of Democrats said they approve.

Last week, Trump delivered a subdued speech that celebrated his primary wins and looked ahead to a matchup with Clinton. His campaign told allies that Trump was strategizing for a new phase of the campaign.

But by this week â€” after a series of fiery rallies in which he called out enemies by name and then his response to Orlando â€” many Republicans were left scratching their heads.

Lanhee Chen, a GOP foreign policy expert who served as policy director on Mitt Romneyâ€™s 2012 campaign, called Trumpâ€™s Monday speech a â€œhuge wasted opportunity.â€

â€œWhat he has said overall about foreign policy is very troubling,â€ said Chen, who said he has many issues with the mogul but does not consider himself part of the â€œNever Trumpâ€ wing of the GOP.

Chen said Trump needs to â€œstart defining what his presidency would look likeâ€ in â€œmore than just a few sound bites.â€ But he added: â€œIâ€™m not holding my breath.â€
