Hillary Clinton made the case for her presidential bid in a rare interview with Fox News Sunday, reaching out directly to the conservative showâ€™s primary audience: older Republican voters, many of them distrustful of her liberal politics and her conduct as secretary of state, but even more terrified by Donald Trumpâ€™s unpredictable temperament and seeming coziness with Russia.

â€œWe know that Donald Trump has shown a very troubling willingness to back up Putin, to support Putin, whether it's saying that NATO wouldn't come to the rescue of our allies if they were invadedâ€ or â€œhis praise for Putinâ€”which is, I think, quite remarkable,â€ Clinton said, when asked by Fox host Chris Wallace about the recent hacking attack against the Democratic National Committee, which is widely believed to have been carried out by Russia in order to benefit Trump. Clinton didnâ€™t go so far as to suggest that Russian President Vladimir Putin would prefer to see Trump in the White House, but she said it â€œraises serious issues about Russian interference in our elections, in our democracy.â€ Trumpâ€™s history of praising Putin also â€œraises national security issues,â€ she argued.

The sit-down interview, Clintonâ€™s first since becoming the first female presidential nominee of a major party, and her first with Fox News Sunday in five years, was unusual for the veteran politician, who is often criticized for her sporadic interaction with the press. (Unlike Trump, who bombards the media constantly, Clinton hasnâ€™t given a press conference in more than 200 days.) More unusual was what Clinton was trying to do: win over conservatives like George Will, who have been driven from the Republican Party by its decision to nominate as its standard-bearer a former reality TV star with little history of conservative principles.

Clinton faces a steep uphill climb, however, in convincing Republicans that she is trustworthy and wonâ€™t overstep her bounds as president on the issue of immigration, both issues that Fox Newsâ€”which re-aired the 10 A.M. Fox interviewâ€”has repeatedly hammered her on over the last year. Confronted with the fact that two-third of voters say they donâ€™t trust her, the former secretary of state acknowledged she had to do more (â€œI have work to do to make sure people know what I have done and what I will doâ€) but argued that Americansâ€™ impression of her is a caricature, not reality. â€œWhen I left office as Secretary of State, 66 percent of Americans approved of what I do,â€ she told Wallace. â€œI think that it's fair for Americans to have questions. I hope you'll ask Donald Trump why he is so untrusted by the American people.â€

The Democratic nominee also sought to allay Republican votersâ€™ fears that she would take away or limit access to guns as president, a major obstacle to winning over uncertain conservatives who are worried about Trump. â€œI'm not looking to repeal the Second Amendment. I'm not looking to take people's guns away,â€ Clinton insisted, repeating what she had said in her Democratic National Convention speech last week, during which she had accepted her partyâ€™s nomination for president. â€œBut I am looking for more support for the reasonable efforts that need to be undertaken to keep guns out of the wrong hands,â€ she continued. â€œThe vast majority of Americans including gun owners support the kind of common sense reforms that I'm proposing.â€

Clintonâ€™s interview with Wallace was the latest in a series of moves by the presidential nominee to expand her voting base beyond liberal and centrist Democrats to include more conservative voters. Days before, right-leaning pundits had watched with some concern as the Democratic National Convention gleefully co-opted an iconography and vocabulary traditionally belonging to Republicans: giant American flags, patriotic chants, and a parade of high-ranking military officials, police officers, former Reagan officials, and even Michael Bloomberg, once a Republican himself. The spectacle was, they fretted, more American than their own convention, a weeklong celebration of Trump.

Clintonâ€™s interview augurs potential difficulty on the horizon as she seeks to unite believers of old-fashioned, Reagan-era conservatism, with the ideals of a socialist from Vermont and his legion of scrappy supporters. But if anyone can scare more people into the Democratic Partyâ€™s big tent, itâ€™s Donald Trumpâ€”and Clinton is holding open the doors. Already there are suggestions that the Democratic nominee could soon receive the endorsement of high-profile dissenters within the Republican ranks, even if it risks alienating some portion of her liberal base. Fox News itself may soon be shifting toward the center, as Rupert Murdochâ€™s sons, James and Lachlan move to reinvent the network in the wake of Roger Ailesâ€™ departure amid a sexual harassment scandal. If thereâ€™s anyone who can capitalize on the coming shakeup with a carefully-tuned strategy of triangulation, itâ€™s another Clinton.
