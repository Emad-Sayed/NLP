Iran is encouraging its terror allies to pursue the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s children by publishing personal information about them, including photographs of the kids lined up in crosshairs, and declaring, â€œWe must await the hunt of Hezbollah.â€

The publication of the personal information and biographies of Netanyahuâ€™s children follows an Israeli airstrike last week that killed several key Hezbollah leaders and an Iranian commander affiliated with the countryâ€™s hardline Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

Iranian military leaders affiliated with the IRGC threatened in recent days harsh retaliation for the strike and promised to amp up support for Hezbollah as well as Palestinian terrorist organizations.

The information was originally published in Farsi by an Iranian website affiliated with the IRGC and quickly republished by Iranâ€™s state-controlled Fars News Agency.

In addition to biographical details and pictures of Netanyahuâ€™s children, the Iranians provided details about the families of former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ariel Sharon.
