Texas Senator Ted Cruz (R) isnâ€™t about to let the facts get in the way of his narrative, so instead of admitting that his partyâ€™s rhetorical tantrums about hoax videos may have contributed to Robert Louis Dearâ€™s decision to shoot up a Planned Parenthood clinic on Friday, he blamed it on what conservatives would consider a most loathsome manticore: a â€œtransgendered leftist activist.â€

On Sunday, Cruz said that any attempt to link Dear to conservativesâ€™ mission to curtail a womanâ€™s right to choose is merely â€œvicious rhetoric on the left blaming those who are pro-life.â€ He claimed that â€œthe media promptly wants to blame [Dear] on the pro-life movement, when at this point thereâ€™s very little evidence to indicate that.â€ Cruz, you see, is very, very concerned about people who make commonsense accusations based on reports that Dear was mumbling about â€œbaby partsâ€ when he was arrested. Repeating the Republican talking points about Planned Parenthood constitutes, to his mind, â€œvery little evidence.â€

Solid evidence, for Cruz, comes from the person who has been deemed The Stupidest Man On The Internet, who discovered that Dear was listed as â€œFemaleâ€ on a voter registration form, meaning he is obviously, as Cruz identified him, a â€œtransgendered leftist activist.â€

Cruz made that statement while attempting to take the high road, but heâ€™s unfamiliar with such heights and it showed. â€œItâ€™s also been reported that he was registered as an independent and a woman and transgendered leftist activist, if thatâ€™s what he is,â€ he said. â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s fair to blame on the rhetoric on the left. This is a murderer.â€ Apparently, he believed people would walk away from his statement thinking, â€œItâ€™s big of Cruz not to blame leftist rhetoric for a man shooting up a Planned Parenthood clinicâ€ â€” which says quite a bit about how intelligent he considers his audience.

Moreover, given that the only evidence Cruz has that Dear was transgender is a single voter registration form in which he identifies both as â€œFemaleâ€ and â€œUAF,â€ which stands for â€œunaffiliated,â€ it stands to reason that he believes it impossible for a transgender person to be affiliated with the conservative movement in general or the Republican Party in particular. While that may be true, itâ€™s also telling about who he assumes can find a home in the conservative coalition. As ThinkProgressâ€™ Zack Ford reported, no one who knew him believed he identified as a woman, and his ex-wife claimed that â€œhe believed wholeheartedly in the Bible,â€ but that doesnâ€™t constitute the kind of evidence a professional prevaricator like Cruz would consider worthy of mention. He should be commended, though, for his restraint in not arguing that Dear was simply a bank robber who took shelter in the Planned Parenthood clinic, another conservative canard that made the rounds this weekend.
