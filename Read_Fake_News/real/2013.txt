Senator Ted Cruz is now the frontrunner in the Republican race for the White House.

But if you believe the Mainstream Media and the political pundits -- Marco Rubio won the Iowa Caucus.

Just look at Tuesday's news coverage -- they marginalized Senator Cruz -- and glorified Senator Rubio.

And that's the narrative. Cruz may have won -- but Rubio is more electable. And yet... the numbers in Iowa tell a very different story.

One out of three evangelical voters chose Cruz -- so did four out of ten very conservative voters.

And 26 percent of young voters -- 18 to 29 - -- they didn't vote for Rubio -- they also voted for Cruz.

The voters recognize  a simple truth. Senator Cruz has been a man of his word -- a principled conservative -- and that is something the Establishment cannot tolerate.

â€œWhat we are seeing is evangelicals who have been dormant in the political process that are turning out,â€ said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. â€œItâ€™s something we havenâ€™t seen in a number of years.â€

Perkins, who has endorsed Cruz, told me the voters are not interested in a moderate candidate. They donâ€™t want someone in the â€œmiddle.â€

â€œThereâ€™s nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead animals,â€ Perkins said.

Looking back on the results in Iowa, Perkins said there should be one take-away for voters.

â€œDo not listen to the pundits or the polls â€“ but vote your values,â€ he said. â€œIt was values voters and the return of those voters that put Ted Cruz over the top.â€

It's not that the pundits and politicos hate Senator Cruz - they know he can't be controlled -- and that has them terrified.
