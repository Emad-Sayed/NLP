Donald Trumpâ€™s organizational problems have gone from bad to worse to flat-out embarrassing. Hereâ€™s Politico with the play-by-play from this weekendâ€™s Colorado GOP convention, the latest scene of Trumpâ€™s delegate-securing failure:

Unlike in most other states, Republicans in Colorado scrapped plans for a more traditional primary or caucus to award its delegates to this summerâ€™s national convention in Cleveland. Instead, the state GOP selected three delegates from each of the stateâ€™s seven congressional districts at individual contests in the days leading up to the state convention, and then the remaining 13 delegates at the statewide event this past weekend. It was a rather convoluted process that favored campaigns that understood the rules and that had the ground game necessary to take advantage of themâ€”or, put another way, not the Trump campaign.

At the first two district-level contests, the billionaireâ€™s team showed up without an approved list of delegates to pass out to attendees, leaving supporters unsure of whom to back. And then at last Thursdayâ€™s contest, two of the three delegates on the Trump campaignâ€™s list werenâ€™t actually on the official ballot since they failed to pay the necessary registration fees.

This past weekendâ€™s mix-up, though, was an even bigger embarrassment since at least one of the seven misnumbered names on the Trump-sanctioned list lined up with a Cruz-supporting delegate, according to NBC News. (Even without that mix-up, though, Cruz would have likely swept the contest anyway given his well-oiled delegate-selecting machine.) The Trump camp, though, appeared to blame the state GOP for the mistake, pointing to discrepancies between the delegate guides posted on the party's website and the printed materials distributed at the event. â€œWe'll do whatever it takes to protect the legitimacy of our support in Colorado,â€ Trump aide Alan Cobb told NBC, suggesting the campaign may challenge the results. â€œClearly there are some serious issues with the ballot and balloting.â€

Trump remains the favorite to arrive at the convention with the most delegates to his name, but heâ€™s far from assured of the majority of delegates heâ€™d need to win the nomination on the first ballot. Given that reality, the GOP front-runner recently retooled his campaign to address his clear weaknesses in the under-the-radar battle to send loyal delegates to the convention. If those efforts don't start paying dividends soon, though, Trump very well may arrive in Cleveland with the most delegatesâ€”and leave without the nomination.
