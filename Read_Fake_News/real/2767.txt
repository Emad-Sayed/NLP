In Jonathan Chaitâ€™s interview with departing White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer in New York magazine, Chait describes how the Obama administration â€œlost its illusionsâ€ about overcoming partisan polarization.

â€œI think [Obama] believes, and I certainly believe, that while we can always do better, this is a case where structural forces are the large actor here,â€ he told me. Pfeiffer cited three of them. The first is rising polarizationâ€”â€œthe great sorting,â€ as he called itâ€”which, over a period of decades, has driven white conservatives out of the Democratic Party and moderates out of the Republican Party, creating two ideologically homogeneous political organizations.

This is quite a belated discovery of well-established finding in political science.  As Iâ€™ve noted before, the Obama administration has been remarkably slow to understand the nature and origins of our polarized politics.

Hereâ€™s a new resource on that subject. Weâ€™re pleased to announce the first book based on content from The Monkey Cage: â€œPolitical Polarization in American Politics.â€ The book is based on the many contributions to our series on American political polarization in January-February 2014, and edited by Dan Hopkins and me.

As Dan and I write in the introduction:

The result is a collection of pieces from leading experts on polarization that cover nearly every facet of the issue: how American politics became more polarized over time, how much that trend is manifest in different places (Congress, state legislatures, activists, and citizens), what factors are driving that trend, and what reforms might mitigate it. These pieces puncture some of the myths that frequently appear in casual punditry about polarizationâ€”such as the notion that itâ€™s mostly driven by politicians who simply donâ€™t like each other, or that we can blame it primarily on partisan news media. Instead, polarization has deeper structural and historical roots. Indeed, it may even be the norm in American politics. As such, there are no easy solutionsâ€”certainly none as easy as having politicians sit down to dinner with each other.

Below is a list of the chapters and contributors.  It might be a bit late for Obama, but we hope that youâ€™ll find the book worth reading.
