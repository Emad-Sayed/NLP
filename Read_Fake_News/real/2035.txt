The toughest job in politics these days is defending Hillary Clinton, mocked brilliantly by The New York Post as the â€œDeleter of the Free World.â€

Her beleaguered defenders, as they retreat behind the bunker door, are settling on a crude legal defense.

Their mumbo jumbo chorus -- begins with the claim that she didnâ€™t break any laws by doing government business on her private email and ends with the insistence that everybody does it.

Thatâ€™s their story, and they are sticking to it â€” until they are forced to find another one.

That will be soon because, while Hillaryâ€™s Helpers may have a point about fuzzy laws, their argument is ultimately futile. Sheâ€™s not on trial and opponents donâ€™t have to meet a persnickety legal standard to win their case.

Sheâ€™s running for president â€” and she must meet a less precise but more difficult standard. Itâ€™s the test of integrity, and sheâ€™s failed it often during her 30 years in public life.
