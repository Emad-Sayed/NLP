Megyn Kelly has been none too impressed with Republican presidential candidatesâ€™ reaction to their third primary debate and days long tantrum about the CNBC moderators â€” after all, she did see her own revolt of Fox News viewers following her moderation of the first GOP debate â€” so on her Wednesday night program, Kelly confronted Texas Senator Ted Cruz about his recent demand that future GOP debate moderators strictly be Republicans.

Making clear that he thought the debates so far have been â€œterrific,â€ Cruz responded to New Jersey Governor Chris Christieâ€™s suggestion that Republican presidential candidates stop whining and move on from last weekâ€™s debate. Cruz said he was happy to â€œdebate any of the candidates, anywhere,â€ and denied that he planned to sign onto a GOP list of demands for future debates.

But then Cruz explained that his only problem with the Republican primary debates has been the fact that they are moderated by what he calls liberals.

â€œWhy is it that we have Republican primary debates that are moderated by liberal Democrats,â€ Cruz asked, repeating the argument he made on Fox Newsâ€™ â€œHannityâ€ moments following last weekâ€™s CNBC debate. â€œI donâ€™t think that makes any sense,â€ he told Kelly.

â€œThe one rule change that I think the RNC ought to think about is saying that if you have never in your life voted in a Republican Party primary, that you shouldnâ€™t be moderating a Republican primary debate,â€ Cruz argued. â€œLet me challenge you on that,â€ Kelly offered. â€œDo you have any idea whether Bret Baier or Chris Wallace have ever voted in a Republican primary?â€ â€œI have no idea,â€ Cruz admitted chucklingly, before defending his assertion by revealing the secret that neither Kelly, nor Wallace, nor Baier could plausibly be described as liberals. â€œWould we have to submit our voting records to you?â€ Kelly shot back after noting that Cruzâ€™s proposed rule could potentially box out some Fox News anchors from moderating GOP debates. â€œMegyn, it is not complicated,â€ Cruz insisted. â€œIn a primary, donâ€™t have liberals moderating.â€ Watch Kelly attempt to confront Cruz on his GOP only debate proposal:
