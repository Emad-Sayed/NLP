In the second presidential debate, Donald Trump once again relied on many dubious and false claims that have been repeatedly been debunked. His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, on occasion made a factual misstep, but it didnâ€™t even compare to Trumpâ€™s long list of exaggerations.

Hereâ€™s a roundup of 25 interesting and suspect claims. As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debates.

Trump mixes up a story about a long-ago criminal case. Clinton did not laugh at a rape victim.

In 1975, Clinton â€” then Hillary Rodham â€” was a 27-year-old law professor running a legal aid clinic in the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. After a 41-year-old factory worker was accused of raping a 12-year-old girl, he asked the judge to replace his male court-appointed attorney with a female one. The judge went through the list of a half-dozen women practicing law in the county and picked Clinton.

In her autobiography, â€œLiving History,â€ Clinton wrote, â€œI told [prosecutor] Mahlon [Gibson] I really donâ€™t feel comfortable taking on such a client, but Mahlon gently reminded me that I couldnâ€™t very well refuse the judgeâ€™s request.â€ Gibson has confirmed that account in interviews with Newsday and CNN, saying Clinton told him: â€œI donâ€™t want to represent this guy. I just canâ€™t stand this. I donâ€™t want to get involved. Can you get me off?â€

Ultimately, the prosecutionâ€™s case fell apart for a number of reasons, including investigators mishandling evidence of bloody underwear, so in a plea agreement the charges were reduced from first-degree rape to unlawful fondling of a minor under the age of 14. Not until 2008 did the victim, Kathy Shelton, realize that Clinton had been the lawyer on the other side. She has since attacked Clinton for putting â€œme through hell,â€ and she appeared at a news event with Trump before the debate.

The rape case reemerged when the Washington Free Beacon in 2014 discovered unpublished audio recordings from the mid-1980s of Clinton being interviewed by Arkansas reporter Roy Reed for an article that was never published.

In the recorded interview, Clinton is heard laughing or giggling four times when discussing the case with unusual candor; the reporter is also heard laughing, and sometimes Clinton is responding to him.

Here are the four instances:

Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, alleged that in 1991 Clinton, while governor, propositioned her and exposed himself. She later filed a sexual harassment suit. The case was dismissed by a federal judge, who ruled that even if her allegations were true, such â€œboorish and offensiveâ€ behavior would not be severe enough to constitute sexual harassment under the law. That ruling was under appeal when Clinton in 1998 settled the suit for $850,000, with no apology or admission of guilt. All but $200,000 was directed to pay legal fees.

Premiums are expected to increase overall in 2017, but Trump is cherry-picking from the highest proposed increases in the insurance marketplace.

State-by-state weighted average increases range from just 1.3 percent in Rhode Island to as high as 71 percent in Oklahoma. But the most common plans in the marketplace will see an average increase of 9 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundationâ€™s July analysis. These plans have been used as the benchmark to calculate government subsidies.

The vast majority of marketplace enrollees (about eight in 10) receive government premium subsidies. They are protected from a premium increase (and may even see a decrease) if they stay with a low-cost plan. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, â€œanecdotal examples of premium hikes or averages across insurers can provide a skewed picture of the increases marketplace enrollees will actually face.â€

To support the debunked notion that Clintonâ€™s campaign originated â€œbirtherâ€ rumors during the 2008 presidential campaign, Trump once again referenced longtime Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal and Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle. But heâ€™s grasping at straws â€” and once again refused to apologize for his own role in promoting the birther fable.

James Asher, former D.C. bureau chief of McClatchy, has said that Blumenthal â€œstrongly urgedâ€ him to â€œinvestigate the exact place of President Obamaâ€™s birth, which he suggested was in Kenya.â€ McClatchy assigned a reporter to go to Kenya, and the reporter found the allegation was false, Asher said. (We reached out to Asher several times but did not receive a response.)

Blumenthal, declining to elaborate further, said in a statement to The Fact Checker: â€œThis is false. Period. Donald Trump cannot distract from the fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie, and bears the responsibility for it.â€

Solis Doyle said in a recent CNN interview that in December 2007, a volunteer coordinator in Iowa forwarded an email perpetuating the birther conspiracy. Clinton â€œmade the decision immediately to let that person go,â€ Solis Doyle said in the interview.

As in the instance with the Iowa volunteer coordinator, the campaign denounced isolated instances of Clintonâ€™s staffers questioning whether Obama was Muslim. We found that thereâ€™s no evidence that she or her campaign were â€œpressing it very hardâ€ â€” though some of her supporters did perpetuate the claims in the bitter 2008 primary campaign against Obama.

Trump has used this line of attack throughout the campaign, sometimes saying Hillary Clinton was an â€œenablerâ€ of her husbandâ€™s affairs, saying she would â€œgo after these women and destroy their lives.â€

One of the interviews that Clintonâ€™s critics have pointed to is a Jan. 27, 1998, interview on the â€œTodayâ€ show, saying it showed Clinton was discrediting allegations by then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky. This interview took place a week after her husband was accused of having an affair with Lewinsky, and Clinton blamed Republican foes for making false attacks against her husband.

Specifically, critics have pointed to this quote by Clinton:

â€œI mean, look at the very people who are involved in this, they have popped up in other settings,â€ Clinton told Matt Lauer. â€œThis is the great story here, for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it, is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.â€

This interview, by many accounts, was certainly pivotal to saving Bill Clintonâ€™s presidency, as his wife forcefully backed him. But by Hillary Clintonâ€™s account at the time, her husband had not yet admitted the Lewinsky affair to her. That did not happen until Aug. 15, 1998, according to her memoir.

Moreover, at the time of the interview, Lewinsky also denied there had been a relationship. Her lawyer had submitted an affidavit on Jan. 12 from her saying she â€œnever had a sexual relationship with the president.â€ Lewinsky did not begin to testify before the independent prosecutor about the full extent of the relationship until July 27, six months after the â€œTodayâ€ show interview. Lewinsky testified for 15 days, after which the president finally confessed to his wife.

See our in-depth fact-checks on this here and here.

While Trump has ramped up the attacks on the Clintons and the sex allegations against Bill Clinton, the record shows that Trump dismissed or minimized these very allegations for many years. Trump dismissed the women involved as losers and not attractive. Trump even suggested that Americans would have been more forgiving if Clinton had slept with more beautiful women.

Here are some examples (see more here):

In 1998, Trump attacked Paula Jones, who had sued Clinton, alleging sexual harassment: â€œPaula Jones is a loser, but the fact is that she may be responsible for bringing down a president indirectly.â€

In 1999, Trump faulted Bill Clinton for the way he handled the Lewinsky scandal, and complained about his choice in women: â€œHe handled the Monica situation disgracefully. Itâ€™s sad because he would go down as a great president if he had not had this scandal. People would have been more forgiving if heâ€™d had an affair with a really beautiful woman of sophistication. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe were on a different level. Now Clinton canâ€™t get into golf clubs in Westchester. A former president begging to get in a golf club. Itâ€™s unthinkable.â€

During a 2001 interview, Trump again expressed sympathy for Bill Clinton, arguing that the former presidentâ€™s biggest mistake was answering questions about his sex life. Trump said he likes Clinton, and finds it all too easy to understand why the then-president found it hard to answer the question: â€œDid you fâ€” Monica?â€ â€œWhat he should have done is fought for years not to answer it,â€ Trump said in the interview. â€œI mean, isnâ€™t it amazing and terrible that a guy â€” a president â€” is put in that position? He could have gone down as truly great and, instead, you know, heâ€™ll be viewed somewhat differently, which is really a shame.â€

Trump always makes it sound like this is U.S. taxpayer money â€” and he always uses a too-high estimate. Because of international sanctions over its nuclear program, Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe. With sanctions lifted, in theory those funds would be unlocked.

But the Treasury Department has estimated that once Iran fulfills other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. (Much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in China.) For its part, the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion, not $55 billion.

There is no evidence this was the case in the 2015  terrorist attack that killed 14 people. There have been unconfirmed second- or third-hand reports â€” a friend of a friend of a neighbor â€” that a neighbor claimed to have noticed suspicious activity but did not report anything for fear of doing racial profiling. The religion of this supposed neighbor is unknown, but presumably a fear of racial profiling would suggest the neighbor was not Muslim.

Trump is technically correct on the timeline, but Clintonâ€™s staff had requested the emails to be deleted months before the subpoena, according to the FBIâ€™s August 2016 report. Moreover, thereâ€™s no evidence Clinton deleted the emails in anticipation of the subpoena, and FBI director James B. Comey has said his agencyâ€™s investigation found no evidence that any work-related emails were â€œintentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.â€

PolitiFact compiled a helpful timeline of events relating to Clintonâ€™s release of her emails, based on the FBI report. From their timeline:

On July 23, 2014, the State Department agreed to produce records pertaining to the 2012 attacks in Libya, for the House Select Committee on Benghaziâ€™s investigation. In December 2014, Clinton aide Cheryl Mills told an employee of the company that managed her server to delete emails on her server unrelated to government work that were older than 60 days.

On March 4, 2015, the Benghazi Committee issued a subpoena requiring Clinton to turn over her emails relating to Libya. Three weeks later, between March 25 and March 31, the employee had an â€œoh sâ€”â€ moment and realized he did not delete the emails that Mills requested in December 2014, he told the FBI. The employee then deleted the emails and used a program called BleachBit to delete the files.

This is just totally false.

We have found no evidence of his early opposition. Trump expressed lukewarm support the first time he was asked about it on Sept. 11, 2002, and was not clearly against it until he was quoted in the August 2004 Esquire cover story titled, â€œDonald Trump: How Iâ€™d Run the Country (Better).â€

But by the middle of 2004, many Americans had turned against the war, making Trumpâ€™s position not particularly unique. In light of Trumpâ€™s repeated false claim, Esquire has added an editorâ€™s note to its August 2004 story, saying, â€œThe Iraq War began in March 2003, more than a year before this story ran, thus nullifying Trumpâ€™s timeline.â€ We have awarded this claim Four Pinocchios, compiled a timeline of all of Trumpâ€™s comments prior to the invasion in March 2003, and even a video documenting how this is a bogus claim.

Trump is simply wrong when he says the United States is the highest-taxed nation in the world.

The Pew Research Center, using 2014 data, found that the tax bill for Americans, under various scenarios, is below average for developed countries.

In 2014, according to comparative tables of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product â€” the broadest measure of the economy â€” was 26 percent for the United States. Out of 34 countries, that put the United States in the bottom third â€” and well below the OECD average of 34.4 percent.

Clinton overstated the impact of the 2011 New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) agreement, which she helped negotiate as secretary of state.

New START placed tighter limits on deployed strategic weapons, but Russia was actually already meeting the treatyâ€™s limits, for the most part, when the treatyâ€™s implementation began. Indeed, Russia has increased deployed nuclear weapons from 1,537 in February 2011 to 1,796 in September of this year. Also, the treaty does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons, nor does it require them to destroy any existing weapons.

Russiaâ€™s total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline, from 40,000, since 1986. During Obamaâ€™s presidency, Russiaâ€™s nuclear warhead total has hovered around 4,500 since 2012.

Trump cites an Internal Revenue Service audit as his justification for not releasing his federal income tax returns, but the audit does not prohibit from releasing the returns. Richard Nixon, who started the tradition of presidents and presidential candidates releasing their returns, did so in the middle of an audit.

Moreover, Trump has not released his tax returns from before 2009, which are no longer under audit, according to his attorney.

Presidential candidates have no legal obligation to release their returns, but there has long been a tradition to do so for the sake of transparency. Hillary Clinton has released three decadesâ€™ worth of tax returns.

The toppling of Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi â€” at the hands of Libyan rebels aided by U.S. and NATO air power â€” has led to highly unstable governance as the countryâ€™s tribes have vied for influence and power. There are rival governments based in the capital of Tripoli and the eastern city of Tobruk, and neither has fully recognized the â€œunityâ€ government established by United Nations mediators.

The National Oil Corporation (NOC) claims to be operating independently without taking orders from either of the countryâ€™s rival governments, though a rival NOC appears to have been set up in the east. ISIS has attempted to step into the power vacuum. But not a single expert or news article that we consulted said that ISIS has grabbed a single oil field. Instead, militants appear to be trying to disrupt the flow of oil, mainly by scaring workers away.

Claudia Gazzini, a Tripoli-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, told The Fact Checker it was not true that the Islamic State has control of any Libyan oil.

â€œWhile it is true that ISIS has attacked oil fields in the Sirte basin area and destroyed key equipment there, they have not sought to keep control of the oil fields,â€ Gazzini said. â€œAt the moment they appear to have adopted a hit-and-run strategy. There is no evidence that they are pumping out the crude oil and certainly no evidence that they are trading it. At the moment they just appear interested in starving the Libyan state of oil revenues.â€

Trump made a ludicrous claim that U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens made 600 requests for help before he perished in the September 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi. This is a misunderstanding of a figure widely used by Republicans on the House Select Committee on Benghazi, but even they never claimed that these came from Stevens.

The Fact Checker delved deeply into this â€œ600â€ figure. It is a subjective accounting of â€œrequests and concerns,â€ not actual requests for help. There is no dispute that security was inadequate in Benghazi and that the State Department failed to respond to all requests for security. But the shorthand description of â€œ600 requestsâ€ has left a misleading impression â€” so much so that many reporters and lawmakers appear to believe that all of these requests were ignored. At least some of the requests were actually fulfilled â€” and the counting of â€œconcernsâ€ may be subject to dispute.

Homicides were up 10.8 percent nationwide in 2015, the biggest percentage jump in a single year since 1971, according to FBI data. But violent crimes overall have been declining for about two decades, and are far below rates seen one or two decades ago.

Homicides have continued to spike in major cities this year, though the rates remain far below their peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Law enforcement officials, including the FBI, have voiced concerns about the uptick in crime in 2015.

Criminal justice experts warn against comparing crime trends from short periods of time, such as year over year. An annual trend can show a trajectory of where the trend might be headed but still not give a full picture. Many criminal justice experts say crime trends are determined over at least five years, preferably 10 or 20 years, of data.

Trump takes Clintonâ€™s statement out of context. During a March 2016 town hall, Clinton was asked by a voter: â€œMake the case to poor whites who live in Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, who vote Republican, why they should vote for you based upon economic policies versus voting for a Republican?â€

Clinton gave a lengthy response, which included the line, â€œWeâ€™re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.â€ It was part of her longer answer about how transitioning away from coal-powered plants has already affected mining communities, and her plan to help coal mine workers adjust after losing factory jobs, as explained in her November 2015 policy proposal for revitalizing coal communities.

Hereâ€™s her full answer. The portion that Trump cited is in bold.

This is easy to disprove. Letâ€™s look at the tweet, sent at 5:30 a.m. regarding former Miss Universe Alicia Machado:

Trump claims that Machado is â€œno angel.â€ No sex tape has surfaced since Trump sent out the late-night tweet. But he clearly tweeted that people should â€œcheck out sex tape.â€

Itâ€™s unclear what Trumpâ€™s source is on this one, and his campaign did not respond to our inquiry. In 2015, 24 percent of black people lived below poverty levels, according to the Census. Black people had the highest rate of poverty among all racial groups (21 percent of Hispanics, 11 percent of Asians and 11.6 percent of whites).

Moreover, the majority of black people do not live in the â€œinner city,â€ as the NAACP tweeted during the debate.

Research shows that as of 2010, the majority of blacks, Asians and Latinos in metropolitan areas lived in the suburbs.

Coal is not clean. When burned in power plants, it emits sulfur dioxides, nitrous oxides and mercury unless coal-fired power plants have scrubbers to remove those from the air, thanks to regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency that Trump said was â€œso restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.â€

Coal also emits carbon dioxide, which the Supreme Court in 2007 said was a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. That carbon dioxide can only be removed from emissions at great cost, and the technique is not currently in use except in areas where it can be used for enhanced oil recovery.

Finally, the act of mining coal is not clean. It either involves open-pit mines or underground mines that often pollute waters. And coal-fired power plants also produce coal ash waste that is often kept in ponds that are prone to leaking.

Probably the major reason for the decline in coal use is the discovery of a way to tap into shale gas, which has brought down the price of natural gas. Many utilities are switching to natural gas.

Actually, the United States is still a net importer of crude oil and refined petroleum products. It imported 5.3 million barrels a day in July, according to the Energy Information Administration. That is, however, down sharply from the 13 million barrels a day of imports reached in 2006.

Clinton went onto say, â€œWe are not dependent upon the Middle East.â€ Thatâ€™s correct, but itâ€™s been the case for years. Canada is the biggest source for American oil imports â€” more than the entire Persian Gulf combined.

This is wrong. The Obama administration has admitted 12,500 refugees over the past fiscal year, which slightly exceeded a goal of 10,000. Even so, this is about one-third accepted by Canada, with a much smaller population.

Trump in the past has claimed that Clinton wants to admit 620,000 refugees in her first term. Clinton has supported accepting up to 65,000 refugees from Syria in one year. This is 55,000 more than the Obama administrationâ€™s plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year.

The 620,000 figure that Trump often uses is based in the unverified assumption that Clinton would continue at that pace for every year of her first term, on top of the Obama administrationâ€™s proposal for 100,000 total refugees for fiscal year 2017. (Multiply 155,000 four times and you reach 620,000.) After Trump made his comment about â€œhundreds of thousands,â€ moderator Martha Raddatz deftly noted that Clinton had asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000.

Clintonâ€™s talking point is out of date. The Census Bureau reported in September that median income was up 5.2 percent from 2014 to 2015, to $56,516. This is the first annual increase in median household income since 2007, the year before the Great Recession.

The United States has a trade deficit of about $500 billion in goods and services. Trump appears to be referring the deficit in goods, which was nearly $800 billion in 2015, according to the Census Bureau.

This is not the full story. The federal government weighed several factors when considering bids for redevelopment of the Old Post Office building: 50 percent were qualitative (including past performance of the developer, site plan and design concept) and 50 percent were quantitative (developerâ€™s financial capability and capacity and the developerâ€™s financial offer).

Two factors weighed heavily in Trumpâ€™s favor: the financial backing of major real estate investor Colony Capital and the design by prominent architect Arthur Cotton Moore.

Trump had submitted the bid with Colony Capital as the financial backer, and the Trump Organization as the lead developer. The Washington Postâ€™s Jonathan Oâ€™Connell wrote: â€œColony is a major global investor in real estate, which bolstered Trumpâ€™s efforts to secure the deal. At the time, Colony had already invested $45 billion in more than 14,000 corporate and real estate assets, ranking it among the top real estate investment firms worldwide.â€

But after the Trump Organization won the bid, Colony Capital backed out of the deal, saying that â€œthe projectâ€™s timeline became too long for the firm.â€ The Trumps instead contributed $40 million to $42 million in equity and borrowed $170 million from Deutsche Bank.

The selection of Moore â€œbolstered the organizationâ€™s experience restoring or managing historic buildings in New York,â€ Oâ€™Connell wrote. Moore stepped down from the project less than a year after Trump won the bid. He told the New York Times: â€œI left because I couldnâ€™t support what they were doing to the building. They were covering up or tearing out everything that was historic.â€
