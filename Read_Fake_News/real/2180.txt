Republican presidential candidate John Kasich reaffirmed his call for a path to legal status for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., as well as a guest worker program to meet the needs of the labor market.

On CNNâ€™s â€œState of the Unionâ€ show on Sunday morning, the Ohio governor seemed to disavow his previous support for eliminating â€œbirthright citizenship,â€ the law granting automatic U.S. citizenship to almost all children born on U.S. soil.

â€œI donâ€™t think we need to go there,â€ he said.
