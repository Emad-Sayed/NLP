After a two-day botched rollout of his grand vice-presidential reveal, Donald Trump barely shared a stage with Mike Pence on Saturday morning.

On Saturday morning, in the Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan, The Rolling Stonesâ€™ â€œYou Canâ€™t Always Get What You Wantâ€ reverberated in the hall, symbolically announcing the new union of Donald Trump and his veep pick, Indiana Governor Mike Pence.



After a whirlwind 48 hours in which the news of Penceâ€™s pick leaked, and Trump reportedly waffled on the choice so much that he was making midnight calls on Thursday night to try to find an escape hatch, the two menâ€”opposites in most qualitative respectsâ€”briefly shared the limelight behind a podium emblazoned only with Trumpâ€™s name.

As the Indiana governor looked on from the side of the stage, the presumptive Republican nominee devoted much of his address to bashing â€œCrooked Hillaryâ€ Clinton and weighing in on recent global conflicts, including the attempted military coup in Turkey on Friday.

"Great people, amazing people,â€ Trump said of the Turks, switching back and forth from prepared remarks to his usual riffing. â€œWe wish them well. A lot of anguish last night but hopefully it'll all work out.â€

A day after the Trump campaign scrapped the initial scheduled rollout for his vice presidential pickâ€”which was ultimately unceremoniously announced on Twitterâ€”they quickly pulled together an event at the same location where Ronald Reagan announced his 1980 presidential bid, with all the pomp and circumstance of a man meeting a mail-order spouse.

â€œIndiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice,â€ Trump said despite the fact that he reportedly struggled to choose between an establishment-pleasing pick (pushed by campaign chairman Paul Manafort) and two men with whom heâ€™s had better rapport: Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

Much of Saturdayâ€™s speech, a rollout that was accompanied by a website redesign to include Penceâ€™s face and a new logoâ€”replacing a suggestive image that was mocked on social media on Fridayâ€”sounded like any other Trump address.

â€œHillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption,â€ Trump said before suggesting that â€œshe got away with murderâ€ for not being charged after an investigation into her use of a private email server. He dropped typically braggadocious lines like â€œI was the one that predicted it,â€ in reference to Brexit, before seemingly remembering that Pence was supposed to be the man of the hour.

â€œBack to Mike Pence,â€ heâ€™d interject before beginning to discuss his success in the Republican primary again (â€œI dominated with evangelicalsâ€). Trump conceded that one of the reasons Pence was selected was for â€œparty unityâ€ before adding â€œhe looks really good.â€

When he finally called Pence to the stage, the two men shared a brief handshake before Trump waltzed off and gave the governor the floorâ€”choosing not to stand beside him for a visual representation of the Republican ticket.

â€œIâ€™m a Christian, a conservative and a Republican in that order,â€ Pence said to applause in the room. The Indiana governorâ€™s address and policy positionsâ€”which include much more conservative opinions on LGBT rights and abortionâ€”were intended to assuage on-the-fence Republicans who canâ€™t fathom a former reality television star being the standard-bearer of their party.

He told the crowd that Trump had called him with the decision on Wednesday night, which runs counter to the narrative Trump himself presented to the media in various interviews on Thursday, during which time he proclaimed he hadnâ€™t made his â€œfinal, final decision.â€

The tenuous relationship of the two men has developed over the past two months since Pence made a less-than-enthusiastic endorsement of Senator Ted Cruz ahead of the Indiana primary (today, Trump said that endorsement was essentially one for him).

Their policy differences have played out on Trumpâ€™s favorite form of social media, with the Indiana governor tweeting his support of the Trans Pacific Partnership in 2014, something that the real estate mogul is adamantly against.

In December 2015, Pence tweeted: â€œCalls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional,â€ in response to an initial proposal from Trump that the United States place a temporary ban on Muslims coming to the country after the attack in San Bernardino.

But on Friday during his first interview as Trumpâ€™s vice presidential pick, Pence told Sean Hannity that he is â€œvery supportive of Donald Trump's call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States," a more recent iteration of the proposed ban.

Before the two men appear together once again at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland next week, the governor is returning to Zionsville, Indiana on Saturday for what is billed as a â€œWelcome Home Rallyâ€ according to the Trump campaign.
