At least a half-dozen attendees shoved and tackled the protester, a black man, to the ground as he refused to leave the event. At least one man punched the protester and a woman kicked him while he was on the ground. All of the attendees who were involved in the physical altercation with the protester were white. The protester appeared to be shouting â€œblack lives matterâ€ and later removed his sweatshirt to reveal a shirt with those words. At least one attendee shouted â€œall lives matterâ€ as the protester was eventually led out by police officers on the sceneâ€¦

Mercutio Southall Jr., the man who was assaulted, offered these additional details:

The Black Lives Matter protester attacked during Donaldâ€™s Trumpâ€™s Birmingham rally said he was punched, kicked and called â€œn****râ€ while a group of eight or nine people were on top of himâ€¦â€ He said people encircled him, and he was being pushed and punched from every direction. Someone hit him from behind, and the next thing he knew, he was at the bottom of pile. He was kicked in the stomach, and the chest, both men and women. â€œI got enough people off of me that I was able to get up a little bit,â€ he said. â€œSomebody got behind me and started trying to choke me out.â€â€¦ Southall said he was repeatedly called a â€œn****râ€ and â€œmonkeyâ€ and told his life doesnâ€™t matter.

â€œMaybe he should have been roughed up, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing,â€ Trump said on the Fox News Channel on Sunday morning. â€œI have a lot of fans, and they were not happy about it. And this was a very obnoxious guy who was a trouble-maker who was looking to make trouble.â€

In their current state of outrage about anti-racism protests at Americaâ€™s colleges and universities, â€œpolitical correctness,â€ and Black Lives Matter activism, movement conservatives are refighting the Culture Wars of the 1960s and 1980s. Once more, the university is their enemy both because of the American rightâ€™s deeply rooted anti-intellectualism, as well as how it is one of the few spaces where women, gays and lesbians, and people of color are (incorrectly) imagined as having a voice and some pittance of power.

Because conservatives exhibit a high degree of social dominance behavior, any threat to what they view as â€œthe natural order of thingsâ€ is met with fear, a sense of victimization, and feelings of hostility. This dynamic helps to explain the right-wingâ€™s current obsession with â€œpolitical correctnessâ€ and â€œsafe spaces.â€ It also reveals the glaring difference between how movement conservatives and liberally minded people understand the world, and the language they use to describe it.

As originally used and intended by liberals and progressives, a â€œsafe spaceâ€ is one where non-whites, gays and lesbians, women, the differently-abled, and other stigmatized groups and individuals, can be momentarily free from harassment, marginalization and discrimination.

Liberals use the phrase â€œpolitical correctnessâ€ to describe a basic principle that individuals should try to treat one another with dignity and respect.

Conservatives (who of course practice their own type of ideological orthodoxy as â€œpolitical correctnessâ€) are enraged by these notions because they view them as a limitation on their ability to demean, harass and abuse other people.

Moreover, conservatives are especially upset by â€œpolitical correctnessâ€ because it is often an assertion of agency and a demand for respect from marginalized groups against dominant, white, male, institutional authority. The divergent reaction to â€œsafe spacesâ€ and â€œpolitical correctnessâ€ from conservatives and liberals also signals to another socio-political fact. American society is structured around maintaining, promoting, and protecting unearned advantages, life opportunities, and resources for white people. As viewed through the lens of the color line, almost every aspect of American life is a â€œsafe spaceâ€ for white people. This â€œsafe spaceâ€ for whiteness is reinforced by many factors, including, but not limited to, the mass media, residential and housing segregation, racially homogeneous interpersonal social networks, as well as a racist â€œcriminal justiceâ€ system. And when this protective bubble of white privilege is pierced, or in any way challenged, many white folks respond in extremely negative, hostile, and immature ways. When people tell and show you who they really are, you had best pay close attention. When Black Lives Matter protesters exercised their constitutionally protected right of free speech at Hillary Clintonâ€™s and Bernie Sandersâ€™ rallies earlier this year, they were not physically assaulted by those in attendance. In contrast, when Black Lives Matter and other protesters have intervened at Donald Trump rallies they have been met with thuggish violence by his public. It is also telling that Donald Trumpâ€™s supporters began to triumphantly yell â€œall lives matterâ€ while Mercutio Southall Jr. was taken away by police. This slur is a rejection of the basic principle driving Black Lives Matter: African-Americans should have same the full and equal human rights, protections, and freedoms as whites. Any other civic arrangement should be unacceptable in a country that purports to be the greatest country on Earth. To stand against Black Lives Matter is to agree that black people should in fact be second class citizens in their own country. Consequently, it has become abundantly clear in recent months that â€œAll Lives Matterâ€ is the new â€œWhite Power!â€ for the Age of Obama. Research on political attitudes, values, and American history has repeatedly demonstrated the many ways that conservatism and racism is now the same thing in post-civil rights era America. The rise of the Tea Party, the GOPâ€™s extreme rightward shift, vicious and ugly racially driven animus and conspiracy theories towards Barack Obama, the efforts to destroy the gains of the civil rights movement, and now the Know-Nothing-like xenophobia and prejudice against non-white immigrants and Syrian refugees are current events as an example of the Republican Partyâ€™s white supremacist orientation and brand. [This is seen online as well. The YouTube clip of the fracas in Birmingham, Alabama, has hundreds of commentsâ€”many of them are overtly racist, use racially violent anti-black language, lie about how â€œBlack Lives Matterâ€ is a â€œterrorist organization,â€ and deploy the slogans â€œWhite Powerâ€ and â€œAll Lives Matterâ€ interchangeably.] And because he appeals to the most strident, immature, and reactionary part of the American right-wing id, Donald Trumpâ€™s rallies are safe spaces â€” for nativism, white racism, and increasingly, violence.
