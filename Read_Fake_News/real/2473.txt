Right to Rise USA, the pro-Jeb Bush super PAC will be airing a new TV ad in early voting states and the battleground state of Ohio that uses images from the Paris & San Bernardino attacks to depict President Obama as a weak president on terrorism and the former two-term Florida governor as a â€œtested and proven leader who wonâ€™t try to contain ISIS.â€

It is the first campaign ad to utilize the images of both Paris and San Bernardino.

â€œA horrific terror attack in Paris then a brutal act of terror here at home.â€ The 30 second ad starts off as it flashes images from both locations.

â€œIt is time for tested and proven leader who wonâ€™t try to contain ISIS,â€ the announcer continues as Obama flashes on the screen.

Bush has been increasing his focus on national security and anti-terrorism positions and has been severely critical of the presidentâ€™s position on threats from ISIS and other terrorist organizations.

"The threat of global terrorism is the threat for our country. And every day that the caliphate exists is another day that they win and they can recruit terrorists, â€œ Bush said to Special Report anchor Bret Baier on Thursday night.

That TV ad is starting Tuesday 12/8 in NH, IA, SC, NV, OH and on cable.
