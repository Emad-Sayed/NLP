The younger Trump swears his foundation gives all of its money away to good causes. Which is true, if you donâ€™t count the cash spent on Trump-owned resorts. Or the plastic surgeon.

Those are some of the beneficiaries of the Eric Trump Foundation, an eponymous public charity headed by the Republican presidential nomineeâ€™s third-born. Though Eric Trumpâ€”the executive vice president of development and acquisitions for the Trump Organization, and one of his fatherâ€™s top surrogates and closest political advisersâ€”recently claimed his father had donated â€œhundreds of thousandsâ€ to his charity, the only available evidence seems to suggest payments, in fact, went the other way: the Eric Trump Foundation (ETF) paying hundreds of thousands over the last 10 years to host lavish fundraising events at Donald Trumpâ€™s golf courses.

In promotional videos and press releases, ETF touts a 95 to 100 percent donation ratio and implies that by benefit of being a Trump, namesake properties are handed over for charity events at little or no cost. But according to a Daily Beast analysis of annual IRS reports and New York state financial disclosures from the charityâ€™s inception in 2007 to 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, ETF spent $881,779 on its annual Golf Invitational at Trump-owned clubs, a portion of whichâ€”$100,000 in 2013 and $88,000 in 2014â€”was reported as paid directly â€œto a company of a family member of the Board of Directors.â€ In other words, Donald Trump himself.

Donald Trump, and his private foundation, are already in hot water as reports swirl of suspected self-dealing, or using his foundation funds for private gain. Indeed, the man who considers a presidential run as an opportunity to turn a profit made headlines and invited criticism this week, after The Washington Post revealed that the self-professed billionaire had reportedly used monies from the Donald J. Trump Foundation to pay off $258,000 in legal disputes. Previous reports found Donald Trump had also used the fundâ€”which he hasnâ€™t personally donated to since 2008â€”to purchase portraits of himself, and gift $25,000 to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in a possible quid pro quo to head off an investigation into his shady Trump University, both of which may have violated federal and state tax laws. New Yorkâ€™s attorney general is currently investigating the reports.

Of course, viewed through the prism of his fatherâ€™s questionable philanthropic practices, Eric Trumpâ€™s foundation seems downright angelic. Eric Trumpâ€™s foundation operates with almost no overhead: Eric neither pays himself nor his board members and relies on Trump Organization employees who volunteer for whatever the foundation may need. Most importantly, Eric Trumpâ€™s charity has, over the last 10 years according to its tax reports, raised $6.5 million for St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital, a beloved Tennessee-based nonprofit that treats children with catastrophic diseases free-of-charge. That figure nearly doubles, when you include the year-long fundraisers utilizing Trump hotelsâ€”where guests are encouraged to donate and buy special services, a percentage of which goes to St. Judeâ€”and employees, who both contribute their money and volunteer their time by competing in company-wide contests and organizing events like car washes, bake sales, and walk-a-thons, to raise cash that goes straight to the hospitalâ€”over $600,000 this past year, according to ETFâ€™s executive director, Paige Scardigli.

â€œWe pride ourselves on having an extremely low expense ratio and that is only made possible by leveraging off the Trump assets,â€ Scardigli wrote in an email to The Daily Beast. â€œTrump assets are not profiting from these ETF events, but instead they are donating their time and resources to the cause.â€

â€œWeâ€™re so lucky as Trumps to have the best hotels in the world, to have the best golf courses in the world, and other great assets, and weâ€™re so lucky to be able to use those assets at our disposal for a great purpose. And thatâ€™s really what ETF is,â€ Eric says in a 2016 video.

â€œIt sounds like they were just making a number up,â€ said Elizabeth Keating, a Boston University professor who studies nonprofit finance. â€œThey should have had a proposal that said, â€These are the costs,â€™ for which there should be an invoice, detailing what the foundation was paying for. Instead it sounds like the golf course just said, 'Give us $100,000.'â€

Scardigli took the reins as ETFâ€™s director in January, replacing a woman who left the organization after eight months. And hers wasnâ€™t the only high-level dropout this year. The foundationâ€™s Board of Directors and Executive Committee have each lost a member since March: Jeffrey Lichtenberg, a freelance real-estate broker and consultant with a history of bid rigging on construction projects, and Nathan Crisp, until recently, a Trump Hotels executive who police accused of twice slamming a Brooklyn mother to the ground on Easter.

When asked why the Trump Organization didnâ€™t donate the use of the courses, Michael Cohen, a longtime attorney to Donald Trump and board member on the Eric Trump foundation, said, â€œI believe there are certain rules that you do have to pay for certain thingsâ€”theyâ€™re not marked up. Itâ€™s inexpensive. I think thereâ€™s some law that says you have to.â€

Trump National Golf Club Westchester, where ETFâ€™s annual event is held, did not return a request for event pricing, but charities which have held fundraisers at Trump clubs showed similar expenses and revenue in their tax reports (known as 990s), suggesting Eric Trump indeed paid a standard rateâ€”around $100,000â€”for use of his fatherâ€™s property. Tic Toc Stop, a charity dedicated to funding Tourette Syndrome research, paid $51,700 for a smaller golf outing in 2014. And according to The Boston Globe, the Dana-Farber Cancer Instituteâ€”which has held its annual gala at Trumpâ€™s Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, for the last six yearsâ€”paid around $150,000 for a fundraiser with up to 600 guests. The most recent ETF fundraiser boasted 500 attendees.

Though the Eric Trump Foundationâ€™s website says, â€œWe exclusively support St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital,â€ that isnâ€™t the case. In 2012, ETF began donating in earnest to other causes, cutting small checks to 40 individual charities in addition to the outsize donation given to the childrenâ€™s hospital. Some of these small donationsâ€”like the $1,600 to the American Society for Enology and Viticulture, a California wine industry organization where Eric Trump once gave a keynote addressâ€”have seemingly little to do with the charityâ€™s mission of helping sick children.

The catâ€™s cradle of connections donâ€™t end there. The GSM fund paid out $43,231 that same year for their golf tournamentâ€”an annual event held at Trumpâ€™s Hudson Valley course that cost nearly double what the charity gave out in grants that year. They, along with at least six other charities that have received donations from the Eric Trump Foundation since 2012, hold fundraising events at Trump golf clubs.
