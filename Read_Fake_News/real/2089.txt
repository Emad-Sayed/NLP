Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Wednesday rejected a request by an openly gay state lawmaker to ban state-funded travel to Indiana until that state repeals its newly enacted Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

Critics say the law â€” which has triggered a firestorm of reaction across the country â€” could allow businesses to discriminate against gay people and others in the name of religious freedom.

â€œMy family could be denied service in Indiana because of my marriage to another man,â€ Sen. Richard S. Madaleno Jr. (D-Montgomery) wrote in a letter to Hogan on Tuesday. â€œMany of our colleagues could also be denied service because of an Indiana business ownerâ€™s objection to a Marylanderâ€™s marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, appearance, or a myriad of other excuses.â€

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) issued an executive order Tuesday banning city-funded travel to Indiana until the law is repealed. The Democratic governors of Connecticut, New York and Washington state have taken similar action.

Doug Mayer, a spokesman for the governor, said Hogan does not plan to institute a ban. â€œGovernor Hogan is opposed to discrimination in all forms,â€ Mayer said. â€œHistory has repeatedly proven that the best way to effect positive change is through an engagement of ideas, not disengaging from those we disagree with. Political stunts like this are precisely what Maryland voters rejected in last yearâ€™s election.â€

Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) submitted a letter to the Indianapolis Star on Monday that urged Indiana businesses displeased with the law signed last week by Gov. Mike Pence (R) to relocate to â€œopen and welcomingâ€ Virginia.

The commonwealth passed a religious liberties law of its own in 2007. But its focus is on government intrusion into the free exercise of religion, rather than on religious clashes between individuals and businesses.

McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy said the governor is not planning any ban on state-funded travel to Indiana. â€œNo, heâ€™s working on convincing Indiana businesses who are concerned about this recent development to travel to Virginia and bring jobs with them,â€ Coy said. â€œIn fact, heâ€™s hoping to travel there himself and recruit businesses.â€

A Maryland lawmaker borrowed McAuliffeâ€™s idea Wednesday, circulating â€œan open letter to Indiana businessesâ€ that encouraged them to move to Maryland. â€œWith their profoundly divisive action, your state policymakers made it harder for you to attract world-class talent,â€ wrote Del. Luke H. Clippinger (Baltimore), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. â€œGovernor Pence and his cronies put you at an extraordinary competitive disadvantage.â€

Pence strongly defended the law at a news conference Tuesday, focusing on the legal grounds granted to individuals and businesses to defend themselves against claims of discrimination. But he said that the intent of the law was never to allow discrimination and that the state will â€œfixâ€ that to make clear that businesses cannot deny services to anyone.

Madaleno wrote in his letter that Maryland has been a leader in providing legal recognition and protections for all state residents.

â€œWhen other states pass these prejudicial laws,â€ he wrote, â€œMaryland needs to stand up for our values.â€ The Democrat said Indianaâ€™s law would allow businesses to discriminate against people on the basis of their marital status, sketching a scenario in which first lady Yumi Hogan could be refused service because her first marriage ended in divorce.

Mayer said that when Hogan reached that part of Madalenoâ€™s letter, he stopped reading.

The letter drew a rebuke Wednesday from Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert), who cautioned lawmakers against mentioning relatives of fellow elected leaders in written correspondence.

â€œWe had a letter going out the other day that mentioned someoneâ€™s spouse,â€ he said. â€œWeâ€™re not going to get into details, but weâ€™re all big here, men and women. And weâ€™re partners in this, but we donâ€™t mention other peopleâ€™s spouses in any type of correspondence â€” their spouses or children.â€

Madaleno said he was â€œtrying to make the point about how sweeping this type of law is and how it puts many families in Indiana and in Maryland at risk for a variety of reasons.â€

He said he was â€œvery sadâ€ to hear that Hogan considers bans and strong stances against the Indiana law to be political stunts. Referring to the racing group that issued a statement Tuesday opposing the legislation, Madaleno added, â€œHeâ€™s not even standing with NASCAR.â€

â€œWe all have aspects about our lives that probably someone else would find offensive or objectionable from their own religious stance â€” but they shouldnâ€™t be able to deny us service or discriminate against us because of it,â€ Madaleno said. â€œAnd thatâ€™s the point I was trying to make.â€

Madaleno acknowledged that itâ€™s â€œalways difficultâ€ when family members become part of political discussions, but he added: â€œMy family has been part of the political debate in this state for quite a while.â€
