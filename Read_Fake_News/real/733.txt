George W. Bush famously described himself as â€œa uniter, not a divider.â€ A few years into his presidency there was a survey that reported that 49 percent of Americans thought he was a â€œuniterâ€ and 49 percent thought him a â€œdividerâ€ â€” a poignant reminder that Americans are so polarized, theyâ€™re even polarized about polarization.

And of course the same goes for Obama who, like Bush, spent two terms as president trying, but failing, to be a bipartisan figure.

A characteristic feature of polarization seems to be the impression that oneâ€™s own side is reasonable and that all the polarizing comes from the other side of the political aisle.

I came across an amusing example of this today, ironically from a political scientist, Gerard Alexander, who, in an op-ed entitled, â€œJon Stewart, Patron Saint of Liberal Smugness,â€ writes:

This is just too perfect. Itâ€™s a beautiful paradox. If Alexander is right, then there is an important asymmetry in American politics, which is the thing that heâ€™s saying conservatives donâ€™t believe! If heâ€™s wrong, then there is no asymmetry, which is what heâ€™s saying conservatives believe in the first place. Itâ€™s like something out of Lewis Carroll.

Iâ€™m reminded of economist Emily Osterâ€™s quote that economists are different from almost everyone else in society in that they assume everybody is fundamentally alike.

I also think itâ€™s a bit odd for Alexander to describe liberals as â€œfixatedâ€ on Sarah Palin: itâ€™s not liberals who nominated Palin for vice-president, or who put her on TV. Unless you want to describe William Kristol and Roger Ailes as liberals.

Also this, from Alexander:

My strongest memory of Mr. Stewart, like that of many other conservatives, is probably going to be his 2010 interview with the Berkeley law professor John Yoo. Mr. Yoo had served in Mr. Bushâ€™s Justice Department and had drafted memos laying out what techniques could and couldnâ€™t be used to interrogate Al Qaeda detainees. Mr. Stewart seemed to go into the interview expecting a menacing Clint Eastwood type, who was fully prepared to zap the genitals of some terrorist if thatâ€™s what it took to protect Americaâ€™s women and children. Mr. Stewart was caught unaware by the quiet, reasonable Mr. Yoo, who explained that he had been asked to determine what legally constituted torture so the government could safely stay on this side of the line. The issue, in other words, wasnâ€™t whether torture was justified but what constituted it and what didnâ€™t.

First off, let me say that this is a horrible thing to say about Clint Eastwood, who was never involved in this:

Itâ€™s interesting to see what Alexander did there. First, he changed the question from â€œcrushing the testicles of the personâ€™s childâ€ (which Yoo refused to say the government couldnâ€™t do) â€œzap[ping] the genitals of some terroristâ€ (which is, presumably, also a treaty violation but doesnâ€™t sound so bad). Second, Alexander didnâ€™t even say â€œsuspected terrorist,â€ he said â€œterrorist.â€ But of course one of the concerns with torture is that itâ€™s not only done on terrorists, itâ€™s also done on people who get picked up on suspicion of terrorism, or just people who somebody thinks might have some information. Alexander gets to characterize Yoo as â€œreasonableâ€ only by shifting the ground of the debate. He also describes Yoo as â€œquiet,â€ which seems pretty irrelevant to me. Personally, Iâ€™d prefer someone who yells but opposes torture to someone who is soft-spoken and supports it. Then again, I donâ€™t personally know anyone whoâ€™s been killed by a terrorist; maybe if I did, Iâ€™d feel differently.

Anyway, the point is that Alexander demonstrates political polarization in his column, in the very way that he is castigating liberals for unreasonable for seeing themselves as more reasonable than conservatives. And, if youâ€™d like, you could characterize this post as even more polarization, in that of all the things I could write about today, Iâ€™ve chosen this.

My point, though, as a political scientist, is that along with our very reasonable concerns about difficulties of communication between the left and the right â€” an often disturbing lack of national unity â€” comes a corresponding split in perceptions. Alexander is correct to see a tendency among many liberals to think of themselves as more reasonable than conservatives. But his column, ironically, demonstrates the symmetric tendency of many conservatives to see themselves as the reasonable ones. So, instead of mere disagreements on policy, we get disputes about the legitimacy of each sideâ€™s concerns, as well as ahistorical views such as an attribution to liberals of Sarah Palinâ€™s fame.

None of this is new, but it has been getting worse in the past generation, and this particular column reminded me of it.

Finally, itâ€™s data time. This is the Monkey Cage, after all. Here are some graphs from my book Red State Blue State on partisan polarization during the Korean, Vietnam and Iraq wars.
