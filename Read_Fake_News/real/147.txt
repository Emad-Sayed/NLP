Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) came to a convention of libertarian-leaning Republicans and talked about shrinking government, slashing regulations, fighting against the bulk collection of phone data and his great affinity for a rival in the presidential race.

Paul, Kentuckyâ€™s junior U.S. senator and scion of one of the countryâ€™s most famous libertarian families, was expected to lock down the support of libertarian voters in the presidential campaign. But as Paulâ€™s poll numbers have sagged nationally â€” and in such libertarian-minded places as New Hampshire â€” Cruz is trying to pick off what is sometimes called the liberty vote.

Cruz essentially crashed what was supposed to be Paulâ€™s big libertarian party here, the biennial meeting of the Republican Liberty Caucus. Cruz stood in a hotel here on a dreary Friday morning, surrounded by supporters and curious attendees who held signs and jostled for photos.

â€œI was elected with tremendous support from the liberty movement,â€ Cruz said of his 2012 Senate campaign, noting that Rand Paul and his father, former representative Ron Paul (R-Tex.), both endorsed him in that race.

The Texas Republicanâ€™s presidential campaign has been making the case that as Paulâ€™s campaign has floundered, Cruz is viable â€” flush with cash and able to go the distance.

On the trail, Cruz has invoked the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s privacy protections and railed against the Federal Reserve. Last month, the campaign rolled out a video showing eight supporters of Ron Paulâ€™s 2012 presidential campaign who are backing Cruz for 2016.

â€œThe liberty movement has been integral to our campaign since Day One,â€ Cruz said.

Cruz breaks down the Republican electorate into four brackets of support: tea party conservatives; evangelical Christians; establishment Republicans; and libertarians. He sees his base in the tea party and evangelical wings, but he also is trying to siphon off libertarian voters with a message of limited government.

Cruz tailored his speech here in New Hampshire to those voters. He took a less hawkish tone when discussing foreign policy, saying that the United States â€œshouldnâ€™t engage in nation-buildingâ€ and calling for armed Kurdish ground troops to fight the Islamic State.

â€œThereâ€™s no reason for us to get in the middle of the Syrian civil war,â€ he said.

Cruz praised the liberty movement as an â€œamazing thingâ€ and vowed that the size of government will be â€œmaterially smallerâ€ if he is elected president. He promoted a bill he co-sponsored to end the bulk collection of phone metadata â€” an issue that Rand Paul championed this year with a nearly 11-hour Senate floor speech.

â€œThis is the battleground between Cruz and Paul,â€ said Dave Nalle, a former chairman of the Liberty Caucus. He said Paul appeals to privacy-minded libertarians while Cruz appeals to those who want a strict adherence to the Constitution.

â€œI was impressedâ€ with Cruz, said Louis Colavecchio Sr. of Wakefield, R.I., who also said he has not decided whom he will support in the primary.

The scramble for supporters seems to have somewhat strained the cordial relationship between the onetime Senate allies. Last month, Paul said Cruz was â€œpretty much done forâ€ in the Senate after Cruz tried to disrupt the passage of a government funding bill because it would give money to Planned Parenthood.

â€œTed has chosen to make this really personal and chosen to call people dishonest in leadership .â€‰.â€‰. which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the Senate, and as a consequence he canâ€™t get anything done legislatively,â€ Paul said on Fox News Radio. On Friday, Cruz called Paul â€œa friendâ€ and â€œgood man.â€

Paul gave an animated speech here and appeared to be in his comfort zone, saying he wants a government that leaves him alone. He reminded his audience of his marathon Senate speech to defend that principle. He called for reform of the criminal-justice system, and he knocked other candidates for saying they would not hold talks with rival nations. Paul also rapped Congress, labeling a just-passed bill that temporarily funds the government â€œa bunch of crapâ€ and the body itself â€œimpotent and inconsequential.â€

â€œIâ€™m embarrassed that Iâ€™m even a part of it,â€ said Paul, sporting a bright-blue belt with the University of Kentuckyâ€™s logo on it.

Paul played down the threat from Cruz.

â€œBoth here and Iowa, we know where our support is and where my dadâ€™s support was, and we feel comfortable that the overwhelming majority of it is with us,â€ Paul said.

Some libertarians here were uncomfortable with Cruz making religion such a large part of his campaign.

â€œI donâ€™t think heâ€™s going to have as much sway on Rand Paulâ€™s electability as people think he will, because heâ€™s a religious zealot. Itâ€™s too much,â€ said Austin Sekel, 22, who is supporting Paul. Cruz â€œneeds to stop grandstanding on the Senate floor,â€ he said.

Sekel and others said they do not think Paulâ€™s sagging poll numbers will change anything. Sekel thinks Paul has a base of support that has not yet become engaged in the campaign.

Bob Pyle, a pastor from Harrisburg, Pa., said Paul has a â€œsolid, loyal following that is not given to the sounds of throwing red meat.â€ Between those people and Ron Paul supporters, Pyle said the Kentucky Republicanâ€™s fortunes will only increase.

Other people here are not completely enamored of either candidate. Some libertarians have said that Paul has run his race too far from his fatherâ€™s pure libertarian principles. They include John Cisar, 36, of Burlington, Vt.

â€œI think thereâ€™s a big schism among libertarians that heâ€™s fallen short of expectations,â€ Cisar said of Paul. Cisar said that he is not a Cruz fan and that he thinks Paul is the more acceptable of the two in the 2016 race.

â€œHeâ€™s the lesser of the evils,â€ Cisar said of Paul. â€œAnd that doesnâ€™t make me feel really good inside to vote for him.â€
