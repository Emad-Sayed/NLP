Mitt Romney, the Republican Partyâ€™s 2012 presidential nominee, will be talking about the 'state of the race' Thursday.

As yet another general joins Trump's team, what does the pick reveal?

Mitt Romney on Thursday will give a major speech on his view of the 2016 presidential election, according to a news release from his office.

The Republican Partyâ€™s 2012 presidential nominee will be appearing at the Hinckley Institute of Politics in Salt Lake City. The announcement said the subject of his talk was the â€œstate of the raceâ€ but gave no further details.

Hmm. â€œMajor speech,â€ â€œstate of the race,â€ whatâ€™s that mean? Is Mr. Romney going to endorse Marco Rubio or (less likely) one of the other remaining GOP hopefuls?

Weâ€™d guess thatâ€™s not the case. If he were, heâ€™d be appearing onstage with the endorsee wherever he is campaigning. That wouldnâ€™t be in Utah. Also, his friends and aides are saying itâ€™s not that kind of speech.

â€œClose @MittRomney aide says he wonâ€™t endorse or get in, but tomorrowâ€™s speech â€will be worth covering,â€™ â€ tweeted NBC campaign reporter Andrew Rafferty.

Hold it a second, â€œget inâ€? Itâ€™s kind of late for that since the primaries are about half over. Yes, Romney tried to run again at the start of the 2016 cycle, but he got elbowed out of the race by the juggernaut of the Jeb Bush campaign, if you remember. So maybe heâ€™s having second, or third, thoughts. Or hoping that other people think he might be having those thoughts even if he isnâ€™t.

Is Romney going to anti-endorse Donald Trump? This seems more likely. Romney is clearly unhappy with the rise of The Donald, whose demeanor is the opposite of his and whose rise could mean the end of the low-tax, small-government, corporate-friendly GOP that Romney knows and presumably loves.

In recent weeks, Romneyâ€™s been sniping at Mr. Trump from the safety of social media and doing a decent job of it. His style has been to pile on when Trump is already getting pressure on certain stuff.

Thus Romney has urged Trump to release his back tax returns. Heâ€™s pushed Trump to make public off-the-record conversations with The New York Times. Most notably, he hit Trump for the latterâ€™s slowness to disavow the endorsement of former KKK official David Duke.

â€œA disqualifying & disgusting response by @realDonaldTrump to the KKK,â€ Romney tweeted on Monday. â€œHis coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America.â€

Tough words. Also effective words, since they roused Trump to respond with a fairly predictable â€œloserâ€ taunt. Romney hasnâ€™t fallen into the trap of exchanging adolescent jibes about body parts with Trump, as Senator Rubio has. Instead, Romneyâ€™s hit him quick on political substance and then moved on.

That may change Thursday. Itâ€™s even possible Romney will join the #NeverTrump movement and say heâ€™d never vote for Trump if heâ€™s the Republican nominee.

Would that matter? Well, it wonâ€™t derail Trump, who at this point is only a Florida primary win away from wrapping up the GOP presidential prize. Like so many Republican establishment figures, Romney is coming to the anti-Trump battle too late, with too little, to make a difference.

What it might do is give Romney a little free media exposure at a time when the GOP establishment may be mulling over its options. If thereâ€™s a revolt at a contentious convention, whom can the establishment offer as a legitimate Trump alternative? If the old GOP wants to split and field its own third-party candidate, who might that be?

Unlike Rubio or Ted Cruz, Romneyâ€™s never lost to Trump. So Romney may be implicitly offering himself as an alternative, whatever his speechâ€™s specific words.
