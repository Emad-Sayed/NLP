President Obama said world leaders were right to be "rattled" by Donald Trump.

â€œThey are rattled by (him) â€” and for good reason,â€ said Obama of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. The president was speaking Thursday in Japan on the sidelines of a Group of Seven conference, a two-day event focused on the global economy.

â€œA lot of the proposals he has made display either ignorance of world affairs, or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines,â€ said Obama.

He dismissed concerns that attacks by Democratic rival candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were hurting the party's electoral chances.

â€œDuring primaries, people get a little grumpy with each other. Somebodyâ€™s supporter pops off and thereâ€™s a certain buildup of aggravation,â€ Obama said. â€œEvery little speed bump, conflict trash-talking that takes place is elevated.â€
