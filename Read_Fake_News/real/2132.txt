Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina slammed rival Hillary Clinton on Sunday, saying the Democratic front-runner has â€œgotten every single foreign policy challenge wrong.â€

Fiorina, who appeared on "Fox News Sunday," also took a shot at GOP candidate Donald Trump.

â€œDonald Trump is a big Christmas gift wrapped up under the treeâ€ for the Clinton campaign.

â€œShe desperately hopes she runs against Donald Trump,â€ Fiorina said. â€œI, however, am the lump of coal in Mrs. Clintonâ€™s stocking and she desperately hopes she does not run against me.â€

â€œShe can beat Donald Trump,â€ Fiorina said. â€œDonald Trump cannot beat Hillary Clinton. I think itâ€™s very clear.â€

Fiorina, once a breakout star of the GOP who fought her way from the low-polling undercard debates to the primetime stage, has been having trouble in the past few weeks maintaining her momentum.

During last week's fifth Republican debate, Fiorina came under fire after she said she would bring back the â€œwarrior classâ€ to fight the Islamic State and claimed several high-ranking generals had left the military because they didnâ€™t agree with President Obamaâ€™s political policies.

Gen. Jack Keane, a Fox News contributor and one of the generals she said quit, actually retired before Obama took office. Fiorina also said Gens. David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal resigned because they disagreed with the administration; but, in fact, Petreausâ€™ retirement came following revelations he shared classified information with his alleged mistress and biographer while McChrystal called it quits after he was quoted criticizing Obama in a â€œRolling Stoneâ€ article.

Fiorina was also pressed by host Chris Wallace about a digital ad paid for by a super PAC supporting Fiorina that links her to Margaret â€œIron Ladyâ€ Thatcher, the first female prime minister of Britain.

â€œMrs. Fiorina, respectfully, isnâ€™t that a little over the top?â€ the anchor asked.

â€œMany people have commented on the comparison and Iâ€™m flattered by it, frankly,â€ she said. â€œMargaret Thatcher was a great leader for her nation at a pivotal and perilous time.â€

When asked by Wallace about her stagnant poll numbers, Fiorina said she was â€œhappyâ€ with her position and that she is where she wants to be.

She quipped, â€œPeople make up their minds late, and if the polls at this stage and in earlier states were true we would have had President Howard Dean, President Rudy Giuliani, and by the way, we would have already had President Hillary Clinton.â€
