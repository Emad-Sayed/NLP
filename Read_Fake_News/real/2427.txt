Donald Trump is surging in new battleground and national polls at a time when Hillary Clinton faces tough questions not only about her health but her sweeping criticism of her Republican opponentâ€™s supporters.

Several surveys appear to show the Republican presidential nominee effectively ending, at least for now, a post-convention slump that saw Clinton leading in virtually every swing state. Now, a Monmouth University Poll shows Trump taking a narrow 2-point lead in Nevada; a Bloomberg Politics poll shows Trump leading Clinton by 5 points in Ohio; and new CNN/ORC polls show Trump leading in Florida and Ohio.

In the latter survey, Trump leads 46-41 percent among likely voters in Ohio, and 47-44 percent among likely voters in Florida.

â€œWeâ€™ve really had a good month,â€ Trump told Fox Newsâ€™ â€œFox & Friends,â€ claiming heâ€™s enjoying renewed â€œenthusiasmâ€ from voters.

Clinton, though, plans to return to the campaign trail Thursday afternoon after taking three days off to recover from a bout of pneumonia. While her campaign dispatched high-powered surrogates to the stump in her absence -- including Bill Clinton and President Obama -- the Democratic nomineeâ€™s presence could help reset the race once again.

The contest remains tight, and the polls are hardly uniform. A Quinnipiac University national poll released Wednesday showed Clinton leading 48-43 percent among likely voters.

But that still represents a narrowing of the race since a late-August survey showing Clinton up 10 points.

The recent surveys come as Clinton grapples with new controversies on two fronts: Her comment at a Friday fundraiser that half of Trumpâ€™s backers are in a â€œbasket of deplorables,â€ and her campaignâ€™s handling of a health scare on Sunday during a 15th anniversary ceremony honoring victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Clinton has since expressed regret for her â€œdeplorablesâ€ comment, though Trump has called on her to outright retract it. And Clintonâ€™s campaign has sought to answer questions about the former secretary of state's health, after Clinton was seen stumbling at the 9/11 memorial event in New York City.

The campaign said she was overheated and dehydrated, and revealed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. While the incident revived long-simmering questions about her health, the campaign on Wednesday released additional medical details. Dr. Lisa Bardack, Clintonâ€™s physician, said she is â€œrecovering well with antibiotics and rest.â€

Bardack also said Clinton remains â€œhealthy and fit to serve.â€

Trump, too, has tried to answer questions about his own health. He discussed the results of a recent physical with TVâ€™s â€œDr. Oz,â€ and told Fox News on Thursday â€œthey were good.â€ The discussion with â€œDr. Ozâ€ will air on his show Thursday.

Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign maintains they always knew states like Ohio would be competitive â€“ and they are building out their operation there.

The campaign announced that they will open a half-dozen new offices in the state, bringing their total to 54.
