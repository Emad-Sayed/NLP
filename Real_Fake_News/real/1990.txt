Carly Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, said her chances of running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 are â€œvery high.â€

Speaking on â€œFox News Sunday,â€ the 2010 Senate candidate said she is â€œhigher than 90 percentâ€ likely to enter the race, with an announcement coming in late April or early May.

Fiorina said she could appeal to voters with a â€œdeep understanding of how the economy actually works, having started as a secretary and become the chief executive of the largest technology company in the world.â€

She added that she has relationships with â€œmany of the world leaders on the stage todayâ€ and that she understands executive decision-making, as well as how to change large bureaucracies for the better.

Discussing the economy, Fiorina said the government has â€œtangled people up from a web of dependence from which they canâ€™t escape.â€ She also said the government is â€œcrushing small businesses now.â€

In a nod to the populist, anti-Wall Street themes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Fiorina said big banks are thriving while community banks go out of business.

â€œIf we want mainstream and the middle class going and growing again, weâ€™ve got to get small and family-owned businesses going and growing again,â€ she said.

Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Fiorina was a 2010 California gubernatorial candidate. She actually ran as a U.S. Senate candidate that year. The article has been corrected.
