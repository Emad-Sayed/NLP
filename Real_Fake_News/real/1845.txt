Whoever dubbed Tuesday, April 26 the â€œAcela Primaryâ€ (because the five states that held primaries on that day coincide with the route of Amtrakâ€™s fastest carrier) needs a refresher in how trains and Republican presidential hopefuls run.

The Washington-to-Boston Acela service is known for the three things: speed, â€œquiet carsâ€ and higher fares.

You wonâ€™t find those first two traits â€“ swiftness and silence â€“ in this boisterous, time-consuming GOP affair. Expensive, yes, but not a joy ride.

Here are four takeaways, now that the Republican local has completed its northeastern course.

Trump Towered. Iâ€™ve kept struggling with a way to best characterize Donald Trumpâ€™s roll â€“ New York last week; Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island all this week.

One thought: Trump 2016 looks a lot like the American map circa the mid-1700â€™s. Heâ€™s conquered 12 of the 13 original colonies (New Jersey votes on June 7), plus most of the southeast. Except for a few states here and there, Trump controls the American continent east of the Mississippi River.

But now the race moves west. First up: Indiana, on May 3 (more on that in a moment). A week later: West Virginia and Nebraska.

After that, the GOP field spends quality time on the West Coast â€“ two weeks in Oregon and Washington â€“ before a final push in California, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and the aforementioned New Jersey.

The question: Trump has momentum as he steps off the Acela. Then again, so too did Texas Sen. Ted Cruz after he rolled Trump in Wisconsinâ€™s April 5 primary.

From this point forward to California, will it be â€œnomemtumâ€ or â€œbig moâ€ for The Donald?

Isnâ€™t It Bromantic? Youâ€™ve heard of Rudolph Valentino, but maybe not Jean Acker. She was Valentinoâ€™s first wife â€“ best known for supposedly locking him out of the bedroom on their wedding night, never consummating the marriage, yet suing for the legal right to â€œMrs. Rudolph Valentinoâ€.

The political marriage between Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (quicker even than Valentino and Ackerâ€™s two-month courtship) may not turn out to be as cinematic.

But there is the matter of consummation.

Cruz thinks Kasich intends to cede Indiana to the more conservative Texan; Kasich has told reporters heâ€™s not instructing his followers to switch to Cruz.

Itâ€™s anyoneâ€™s guess as to whether Cruz and Kasich much care for each other. What I donâ€™t understand: why they felt the need to go public with their hasty nuptials. Other than the obvious reason: they both realize the urgency of the moment â€“ far behind in delegates, needing to defeat Trump soon before he salts away the GOP nomination.

Itâ€™s funny how fast things can change in politics: we entered April with Trump looking wobbly; weâ€™ll exit the month with Cruz and Kasich resorting to a bromance that reeks of desperation.

Hoosier Daddy. A word about campaigning in Indiana, home to a pivotal presidential contest and a contentious GOP Senate primary both of which are playing out along â€œestablishment/outsiderâ€ lines: if I were working the basketball-crazy state, Iâ€™d want one of three individuals by my side â€“ basketball legend Larry Bird, former Indiana University Coach Bobby Knight, or the kid who drained the jumper at the end of â€œHoosiersâ€.

OK, Jimmy Chitwood doesnâ€™t exist in real life and â€œLarry Legendâ€ isnâ€™t all that political (though he once snubbed Ronald Reagan). That leaves us with Coach Knight, whoâ€™s appearing with Trump at a Wednesday evening rally in Indianapolis.

Itâ€™s not the first sports endorsement to come Trumpâ€™s way â€“ Buffalo Bills Coach Rex Ryan warmed up the crowd for him at a rally the day before New Yorkâ€™s primary.  And it begs the question of pro-Trump star power other than the â€œApprenticeâ€ and Gary Busey, Wayne Newton and Jon Voight.

With polls showing Trump holding a narrow lead among Hoosiers, Cruz could use some star-power of his own â€“ better yet, maybe a Gene Hackman pep talk.

California. The Chicago Cubs have waited 71 years for a World Series appearance; 108 years for a title. Californiaâ€™s absence from the national political picture seems just as pronounced.

Post-Acela Primary, Trumpâ€™s delegate count has risen well into the 900â€™s. That puts him three-fourths of the way to 1,237, which is now officially out of reach for Cruz (until after a first ballot in Cleveland, when pledged delegates can begin switching their votes).

Hereâ€™s why California matters more with each passing week: Trump canâ€™t win without taking a gluttonous portion of the Golden Stateâ€™s 172 GOP delegates (to get to 1,237 on June 7, Iâ€™m guessing heâ€™ll have to score 140 delegates); as such, itâ€™s the #nevertrump movementâ€™s last chance to derail him.

In California Amtrak parlance, that primary would be a ticket on the Coast Starlight â€“ a three-day ride along the West Coast that isnâ€™t fast and isnâ€™t cheap.

And unlike Tuesdayâ€™s Acela experience: maybe the only real hope of throwing Trump from the train.
