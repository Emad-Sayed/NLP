Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson suggested Sunday that Congress would be jeopardizing national security if it withholds his agencyâ€™s funding to undermine President Barack Obamaâ€™s executive action shielding millions of illegal immigrants from deportation. The administration is appealing a federal courtâ€™s ruling that blocked the executive order.

â€œThere are some who want to defund our executive actions and do it in a way that holds up the entire budget of homeland security for this nation. That is unacceptable from a public safety, homeland security view,â€ Mr. Johnson said on Fox News Sunday. Without congressional action, DHS funding expires Friday at midnight.
