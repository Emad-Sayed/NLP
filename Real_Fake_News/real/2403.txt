Less than three months before the kickoff Iowa caucuses, there is growing anxiety bordering on panic among Republican elites about the dominance and durability of Donald Trump and Ben Carson and widespread bewilderment over how to defeat them.

Party leaders and donors fear that nominating either man would have negative ramifications for the GOP ticket up and down the ballot, virtually ensuring a Hillary Rodham Clinton presidency and increasing the odds that the Senate falls into Democratic hands.

The party establishment is paralyzed. Big money is still on the sidelines. No consensus alternative to the outsiders has emerged from the pack of governors and senators running, and there is disagreement about how to prosecute the case against them. Recent focus groups of Trump supporters in Iowa and New Hampshire commissioned by rival campaigns revealed no silver bullet.

In normal times, the way forward would be obvious. The wannabes would launch concerted campaigns, including television attack ads, against the ­front-runners. But even if the other candidates had a sense of what might work this year, it is unclear whether it would ultimately accrue to their benefit. Trumpâ€™s counterpunches have been withering, while Carsonâ€™s appeal to the base is spiritual, not merely political. If someone was able to do significant damage to them, thereâ€™s no telling to whom their supporters would turn, if anyone.

â€œThe rest of the field is still wishing upon a star that Trump and Carson are going to ­self-destruct,â€ said Eric Fehrnstrom, a former adviser to 2012 nominee Mitt Romney. But, he said, â€œthey have to be made to self-destruct. .â€‰.â€‰. Nothing has happened at this point to dislodge Trump or Carson.â€

Fehrnstrom pointed out that the fourth debate passed this week without any candidate landing a blow against Trump or Carson. â€œWeâ€™re about to step into the holiday time accelerator,â€ he said. â€œYou have Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Yearâ€™s, then Iowa and a week later, New Hampshire, and itâ€™s going to be over in the blink of an eye.â€

According to other Republicans, some in the party establishment are so desperate to change the dynamic that they are talking anew about drafting Romney â€” despite his insistence that he will not run again. Friends have mapped out a strategy for a late entry to pick up delegates and vie for the nomination in a convention fight, according to the Republicans who were briefed on the talks, though Romney has shown no indication of reviving his interest.

For months, the GOP professional class assumed Trump and Carson would fizzle with time. Voters would get serious, the thinking went, after seeing the outsiders share a stage with more experienced politicians at the first debate. Or when summer turned to fall, kids went back to school and parents had time to assess the candidates. Or after the second, third or fourth debates, certainly.

None of that happened, of course, leaving establishment figures disoriented. Consider Thomas H. Kean Sr., a former New Jersey governor who for most of his 80 years has been a pillar of his party. His phone is ringing daily, bringing a stream of exasperation and confusion from fellow GOP power brokers.

â€œPeople usually start off in the same way: Pollyanna-ish,â€ Kean said. â€œThey assure me that Trump and Carson will eventually fade. Then weâ€™ll talk some more, and I give them a reality check. Iâ€™ll say, â€The guy in the grocery store likes Trump. So does the guy who cuts my hair. Theyâ€™re probably going to stick with him. Who knows if this ends?â€™â€‰â€

South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, herself an outsider who rode the tea party wave into office five years ago, explained the phenomenon.

â€œYou have a lot of people who were told that if we got a majority in the House and a majority in the Senate, then life was gonna be great,â€ she said in an interview Thursday. â€œWhat youâ€™re seeing is that people are angry. Whereâ€™s the change? Why arenâ€™t there bills on the presidentâ€™s desk every day for him to veto? Theyâ€™re saying, â€Look, what you said would happen didnâ€™t happen, so weâ€™re going to go with anyone who hasnâ€™t been elected.â€™â€‰â€

Before Tuesdayâ€™s debate in Milwaukee, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker had a reception at the Pfister Hotel with party leaders, donors and operatives. There was little appetite for putting a political knife in the back of either Trump or Carson, according to one person there. Rather, attendees simply hoped both outsiders would go away.

There are similar concerns about Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who is gaining steam and is loathed by party elites, but they are more muted, at least for now.

Charlie Black, who has advised presidential campaigns since the 1970s, said he believes the 2016 contest â€œwill eventually fall into the normal pattern of one outsider and one insider, and historically the insider always wins.â€

Black said he was briefed on the findings of two recent private focus groups of Trump supporters in Iowa and New Hampshire that showed these voters knew little about his policy views beyond immigration. â€œThings like universal health care and other more liberal positions heâ€™s taken in the past will all get out before people vote in New Hampshire,â€ he said. Black said the focus groups were commissioned by two rival campaigns, but he was not authorized to identify them.

One well-funded outside group, the Club for Growth, has aired ads attacking Trump in Iowa and more recently came out against Carson as well. â€œDonald Trump and Doctor Ben Carson are in over their heads,â€ said Club for Growth President David McIntosh, labeling both candidates as â€œpretenders.â€

Still, the party establishmentâ€™s greatest weapon â€” big money â€” is partly on the shelf. Kenneth G. Langone, a founder of Home Depot and a billionaire supporter of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, said he is troubled that many associates in the New York financial community have so far refused to invest in a campaign due to the raceâ€™s volatility.

â€œSome of them are in, but too many are still saying, â€Iâ€™ll wait to see how this all breaks,â€™â€‰â€ Langone said. â€œPeople donâ€™t want to write checks unless they think the candidate has a chance of winning.â€ He said that his job as a ­mega-donor â€œis to figure out how we get people on the edge of their chairs so they start to give money.â€

Many of Romneyâ€™s 2012 National Finance Committee members have sat out the race so far, including Peter A. Wish, a Florida doctor whom several 2016 candidates have courted.

â€œIâ€™m not a happy camper,â€ Wish said. â€œHopefully, somebody will emerge who will be able to do the job,â€ but, he added, â€œIâ€™m very worried that the Republican-base voter is more motivated by anger, distrust of D.C. and politicians and will throw away the opportunity to nominate a candidate with proven experience that can win.â€

The apprehension among some party elites goes beyond electability, according to one Republican strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the worries.

â€œWeâ€™re potentially careening down this road of nominating somebody who frankly isnâ€™t fit to be president in terms of the basic ability and temperament to do the job,â€ this strategist said. â€œItâ€™s not just that it could be somebody Hillary could destroy electorally, but what if Hillary hits a banana peel and this person becomes president?â€

Angst about Trump intensified this week after he made two comments that could prove damaging in a general election. First, he explained his opposition to raising the minimum wage by saying â€œwages are too high.â€ Second, he said he would create a federal â€œdeportation forceâ€ to remove the more than 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally.

â€œTo have a leading candidate propose a new federal police force that is going to flush out illegal immigrants across the nation? Thatâ€™s very disturbing and concerning to me about where that leads Republicans,â€ said Dick Wadhams, a former GOP chairman in Colorado, a swing state where Republicans are trying to pick up a Senate seat next year.

Said Austin Barbour, a veteran operative and fundraiser now advising former Florida governor Jeb Bush: â€œIf we donâ€™t have the right [nominee], we could lose the Senate, and we could face losses in the House. Those are very, very real concerns. If weâ€™re not careful and we nominate Trump, weâ€™re looking at a race like Barry Goldwater in 1964 or George McGovern in 1972, getting beat up across the board because of our nominee.â€

George Voinovich, a retired career politician who rose from county auditor to mayor of Cleveland to governor of Ohio to U.S. senator, said this cycle has been vexing.

â€œThis business has turned into show business,â€ said Voinovich, who is backing Ohio Gov. John Kasich. â€œWe canâ€™t afford to have somebody sitting in the White House who doesnâ€™t have governing experience and the gravitas to move this country ahead.â€
