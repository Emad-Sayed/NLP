Republicans face a lot of difficult decisions this year, but for the party to come back strong after Donald Trumpâ€™s divisive candidacy â€“ for it to keep its brand as the free-market, democracy-loving, opportunity-focused alternative to the Democrats â€“ the least-worst option is a major loss in the presidential race.

By selecting a nominee that does not reflect the usual fiscal policies, a victory for Trump will mean a shift in the partyâ€™s focus. Even if the rest of the GOP holds fast to the platform or to traditional conservative values, the presidentâ€™s policies always reshape the party.

If you have ever promoted a local candidate to voters, you know this is true â€“ the public looks at the top of the ticket first and judges the party by that personâ€™s views. Many Trump supporters will see his win as a referendum on their policies and will work to make the party reflect that. Fellow Republicans will either need to accept that or leave. 



We have no idea what a Trump presidency will look like, but based on his campaign, it will be filled with outrageous gaffes, inarticulate interviews on policy and offensive media blitzes focused on non-issues. Trump will most likely lose minorities and women, creating a wider divide that the GOP must bridge in the future. Many young voters will continue to associate Trump with the party long after he leaves office. This would only further damage Republicans and set us up for heavy losses in 2018.

Not to mention the party will continue to hemorrhage its best and brightest. Candidates, staff and volunteers have already walked away from Trump, and thereâ€™s no question it will keep happening. If Trump gains a greater control of the party, these people might even be forced out.

But letâ€™s say Trump doesnâ€™t win and Hillary Clinton claims the White House. If Trump only trails her by a few points, you can bet he will blame the Republicans who voted their conscience. Or heâ€™ll kick up dirt over the â€œriggedâ€ system, as he has already alluded to. Trump supporters in the party will go on a witch hunt, looking for anyone who acted disloyally to the Republican nominee. That in-fighting could destroy the party.
