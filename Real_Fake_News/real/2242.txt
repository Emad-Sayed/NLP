With a strong win in South Carolina on Saturday night, Donald Trump has officially upended the 2016 Republican primaries.

SPARTANBURG, S.C. â€” When Donald Trump speaks, he has a habit of gripping the lectern with all but the middle finger of his left hand. The middle finger wriggles about, curling up and down with the rhythm of his words. On Saturday night, as he addressed the crowd after winning the primary here by a ten-point margin, it seemed to be wriggling at all of us.

â€œA couple of the pundits said, â€Well, if a couple of the other candidates dropped out, if you add their scores together, itâ€™s going to equal Trump,â€™â€ he said, doing his best impersonation of a Beltway Idiot. The crowd booed and Trump threw his hands out. â€œRight?â€ he said, â€œtheyâ€™re geniuses. They donâ€™t understand that, as people drop out, Iâ€™m gonna get a lot of those votes also! You donâ€™t just add them together.â€

In the eight months since he first sailed down the escalator in Trump Tower to announce his candidacy, Trump has watched as every single prediction about his campaign, made by so-called experts, has been proven wrong. Not that winning South Carolina means heâ€™ll win it allâ€”Newt Gingrich beat Mitt Romney here by thirteen points in 2012. As it stands now, Trump has 61 delegates. To win the nomination, he needs 1,237. But Trump wasnâ€™t supposed to make it this far to begin with.

It was supposed to be a blip, and then it was supposed to collapse under the weight of its own arrogance, and then it was supposed to be destroyed by the knights in the establishment, and then the voters were supposed to get serious.

Well, they were serious here at the Marriott on North Church Street on Saturday, just like they had been at the Executive Court Banquet Facility in Manchester, New Hampshire ten days ago after he won there, but not in the way that anybody couldâ€™ve anticipated back in June.

His calls for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border were mocked by the experts then as proof of his inherent silliness. And it is a stupid idea, one that couldnâ€™t work even if he managed to get it done. But on Saturday, as he spoke about trade with Mexico, people in the audience began shouting, â€œBuild a wall!â€ He turned to one man and said, â€œWeâ€™re gonna build a wall, donâ€™t worry.â€ He turned back to the audience and asked them a question, â€œweâ€™re gonna do the wall and, by the way, whoâ€™s gonna pay for the wall?â€ A chorus responded, â€œMexico!â€

The polls here had shown for months, much like in New Hampshire, that Trump had a sizable lead over the rest of the field. But to think that he could win anywhere was, in a lot of ways, to admit that everything we think we know about politics and what the people who participate in the process believe is bullshit.

â€œHistory will say that on this night in South Carolina, we took the first step forward to the beginning of a new American century," Rubio declared from his rally in Columbia, SC.

He did not explain what was historic about the evangelical in the race losing the evangelical vote in a state where â€”according to an exit pollâ€”73 percent of Republican voters said they consider themselves born-again or evangelical Christians. Trump, whose cursing is part of his stump speech, is on his third wife, admitted on TV that heâ€™d never asked God for forgiveness, and this week got into a fight with The Pope.

And then, not only did he win, but he won Beaufort, the stateâ€™s only majority-Catholic county. Ted Cruz, who beat Trump in Iowa thanks to the evangelical community and invested millions here to turn them out again, came in third place. Marco Rubio, a Catholic, finished a distant second. Jeb Bush, a converted Catholic, dropped out altogether.

Before Trump descended on stage, bathed in pink and purple lights fit for one of his pageants, his fans milled about on the red and gold carpet, picking at plates of cheese and fruit and drinking booze from one of two cash bars. The extent to which their outfits of sweat clothes or sequined mini-dresses or jeans and t-shirts were accessorized with TRUMP swagâ€”scarves and pins and buttons and a silicone mask of his likeness, in one caseâ€”made the event feel like a convention.

His fans are predominantly white, usually older, working people or retired working people. Oftentimes theyâ€™re very religious, but thatâ€™s not what motivates them. They feel as if the country has left them behind, but they differ from the Tea Partiers of 2010 in that they are not political and they are uninterested in policy unless the policy amounts to a giant fuck-you to a deserving group, like China, or â€œspecial interests.â€ The phrase Make America Great Again, to them, is a legitimate campaign platform.
