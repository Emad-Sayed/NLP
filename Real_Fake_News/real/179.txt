The elites in Washington almost uniformly believe Hillary Clinton will be elected president in November. The conventional wisdom underlying coverage of 2016 is that Donald Trump will go down in flames and probably take the Republican Senate with him.

The presumptive GOP nominee has a well-documented history of misogyny, xenophobia and demagoguery. He has alienated women, Hispanics, Muslims, African Americans, Asian Americans and Native Americans. He has mocked the disabled, prisoners of war and Seventh-day Adventists. The speaker of the House and both living former Republican presidents are withholding endorsements.

It should be a slam dunk for HRC, right?

But, but, but: Six months is an eternity in politics, and a year ago no one in the chattering class â€“â€” including me â€“â€” believed Trump had any real shot at becoming the Republican standard-bearer. With Clinton struggling to sew up the Democratic nomination against a socialist septuagenarian â€“â€” sheâ€™s expected to lose tomorrowâ€™s Kentucky primary â€“â€” we cannot foreclose the possibility that she will botch the fall campaign against the billionaire businessman.

The presidency is hers to lose, but here are a dozen ways Clinton can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory:

Remember the Michigan primary? Every poll showed Clinton up double digits, but she lost to Bernie Sanders. One reason is that supporters and field staffers believed she had it in the bag.

The campaign has been using last weekâ€™s Quinnipiac polls showing tight races in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania to shake a greater sense of urgency into donors and activists.

Clinton is at her worst when she thinks sheâ€™s at her best. She tends to rise to the occasion only when her back is against the wall. Remember 2008? Or recall last summer, when Sanders looked like nothing more than a nuisance and polls showed her ahead by more than 50 points, how she joked about wiping her server clean with a cloth and how her handlers literally used ropes to corral journalists at a parade. Over time, she found herself neck-and-neck with Sanders, who is a weak candidate by most traditional measures. Under heavy pressure in the days before Iowa, when it looked like she could lose the caucuses, she temporarily became a much better campaigner â€“â€” then backslid after her wins in Nevada and South Carolina.

When Hillary goes off her carefully scripted message, she has a tendency to gaffe. One reason she is expected to lose Kentucky tomorrow is her declaration at a town hall this spring that, â€œWeâ€™re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.â€

Donâ€™t forget about her other gaffes, like when she invoked 9/11 to defend her coziness with Wall Street, when she called Republicans the enemy or when she said she and her husband were â€œdead brokeâ€ when they left the White House in 2001.

And there was the time Clinton incensed the gay community by praising the Reagans for starting â€œa national conversationâ€ about HIV/AIDS, prompting a quick retraction.

Clinton cannot just make this election a referendum on Trumpism. She must outline a compelling vision for where she wants to take the country to fully activate the coalition that powered Barack Obama.

â€œI am not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or President Obama," Clinton said at The Postâ€™s debate in March.

The presumptive Democratic nominee campaigns in prose, not poetry. And she does not always try to be uplifting in her speeches.

Itâ€™s part of the explanation for why so many millennials, including young women, have spurned her for Bernie. While Sanders promises tuition-free college, she talks about extending an obscure tax credit. As my colleague David Fahrenthold explained in a story about Clintonâ€™s wonkiness last week, this credit can be worth up to $2,500: â€œBut only if students find their Form 1098-T, then fill out the relevant portions of Form 8863, then enter the amount from lines 8 and 19 of Form 8863 in lines 68 and 50 of their Form 1040.â€ That is not going to send a thrill up Chris Matthewsâ€™s legâ€¦.

My colleagues Dan Balz and Anne Gearan spoke with more than a dozen Clinton allies about her biggest weaknesses for a piece on todayâ€™s front page. â€œI bring it down to one thing and one thing only, and that is likability,â€ said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who has conducted a series of focus groups for the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Hart said this is â€œabout the lowest barâ€ for a candidate, and yet Clinton has lower likability numbers today than she did when the campaign began.

Balz and Gearan report that Clinton advisers are working to soften her stiff public image by highlighting her compassion and playing up her problem-solving abilities. â€œI mean, we canâ€™t give her an injection to make her an energetic candidate,â€ one longtime Clinton family supporter and donor said on background. (Read the full piece here.)

5. Moving too far to the right

The Sanders campaign has circulated stories about Clinton forces reaching out to top Jeb Bush donors to convince them that â€œthat she represents their values betterâ€ than Trump.

Clinton, who used to brag about being a Goldwater Girl in 1964, will be very tempted to appeal aggressively to moderate Republicans who are turned off by Trump. On paper, the Democrat will actually be more of a hawk and more willing to use military force than the Republican. The Donald is all over the place on policy, but Clinton is presently to his right on trade and campaign finance.

She needs Sanders supporters to unite behind her. If it looks like sheâ€™s shifting rightward to win votes, she will look inauthentic and many Bernie people will stay on the sidelines.

6. Moving too far to the left

Clinton has treated Sanders with kid gloves recently. She wants him and his people to fall in line after the July convention in Philadelphia, and she calculates that antagonizing him is not worth sewing up the nomination earlier.

The Vermont senator has made clear he wants significant concessions, including very liberal policy planks in the party platform. The Clinton people will be inclined to give on a lot because the platform is not binding. Just last week, for instance, she embraced several reforms to the Federal Reserve that are sought by the progressive wing of the party.

But, if Hillary continues to lurch leftward to satisfy the Bernie people, it will be harder to win those in the middle and woo disaffected Republicans.

You might think itâ€™s unfair to say Clinton cannot go too far left or too far right. But everyone running for president has this problem. It is a difficult needle to thread, yet the Clintons have proven deft at triangulation. Now, Hillary needs to be Goldilocks.

Thereâ€™s no perfect pick, and candidates who look great on paper might turn out to fall flat â€“â€” or have skeletons in their closet.

Citing four people close to the campaign, USA Today reports this morning that â€œClinton is considering a running mate who could make a direct appeal to supporters of Sanders, bridging a generational and political divideâ€ and that â€œClintonâ€™s chief requirements include a candidateâ€™s resume and a fighter capable of hand-to-hand combat with Trump. The campaignâ€™s vetting also prioritizes demographics over someone from a key swing state as she seeks to unify the Democratic voting base.â€

There are parts of every would-be number twoâ€™s record that will upset at least some portion of the Democratic Party. Take this story that just posted on Politico: â€œTargeted by progressive activists hoping to kill his chances of being picked as Clintonâ€™s running mate, Julin Castro is set this week to announce changes to whatâ€™s become a hot-button Housing and Urban Development program for selling bad mortgages on its books.â€

8. Allowing herself to get defined as an insider

Clinton lost to Obama in 2008 by underestimating the electorateâ€™s hunger for change. Once again, Hillary risks coming to represent the status quo in the eyes of voters who want a renegade.

â€œRight now, about 6 in 10 Americans have an unfavorable view of Trump.â€¦ But the country is faring even worse. â€¦ 64.9 percent think we are heading down the wrong track,â€ The Postâ€™s Editorial Page Editor Fred Hiatt noted last week in a column warning Democrats not to celebrate Trump. â€œSo what if even voters who respect Clintonâ€™s competence reject her as the embodiment of business as usual? And what if even voters who do not like Trumpâ€™s bigotry or bluster care more that he will, in their view, shake things up? â€¦ I do have faith in the American voter, I really do. But when two-thirds of the country is unhappy, a rational outcome canâ€™t be taken for granted.â€

In trying to stay above the fray, Clinton could find herself defined by Trump. Remember the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth? John Kerry didnâ€™t push back forcefully enough early on, and he paid a price.

Last week, Trump called Clinton an â€œenablerâ€ of her husbandâ€™s behavior. While objectively offensive, the Democratic front-runner steadfastly refused to respond. â€œIâ€™m going to let him run his campaign however he chooses,â€ she told reporters. â€œI have nothing to say about him.â€

Trump gives a whole new meaning to term â€œbully pulpit.â€ And there is very conventional logic in not responding to every insult and attack: it leads to more repetition of the original charge and keeps it in the news.

Hillary dislikes the media. Her impulse is to keep the press away, to only give the appearance of access and to focus her attention on friendly outlets that will engage in puffery.

Trump, to his credit, talks to basically everyone. It gets him in trouble, like when he told Chris Matthews that women who get abortions should be punished. But the tradeoff is that he has often gotten to set the terms of the debate. If he repeats something enough times, however preposterous, some may come to believe it.

â€œI have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak,â€ Hillary recently said on CNN. A few days later, she clarified on MSNBC that she was not referring to her husband â€“â€” but Rick Lazio and Vladimir Putin.

The former president has caused fewer headaches for his wifeâ€™s campaign than he did in 2008, when he called Obamaâ€™s bid â€œthe biggest fairy tale Iâ€™ve ever seen,â€ said the other side was playing the â€œrace card,â€ and downplayed a loss in South Carolina by noting Jesse Jackson Jr. had won there too.

That does not mean he has not ruined news cycles for his wife in 2016 â€“â€” or has the ability to.

Remember his outburst on the eve of the New Hampshire primary when he accused Sanders of being dishonest and his supporters of being sexist?

Or when he got into an on-stage argument with Black Lives Matter protesters in Philadelphia last month, defending his crime bill and his wifeâ€™s 1996 comment about bringing â€œsuper-predators â€¦ to heelâ€? The next day, he said: â€œI almost want to apologize.â€ But then didnâ€™t.

The campaign must manage WJC appropriately. Itâ€™s hard to control any spouse; a former president â€“ especially â€œThe Big Dogâ€ â€“ is even harder.

Trump will try to make Hillary own all the unpopular elements of the Clinton era. Expect to hear a lot about Marc Richâ€™s pardon and the Lincoln Bedroom.

Hillary will take credit for the popular elements of her husbandâ€™s tenure and take umbrage when Trump tries to pin the unpopular parts on her, as she already has with the crime bill and Wall Street deregulation.

Clinton is not widely seen as trustworthy. Her refusal to release the transcripts of her speeches at Goldman Sachs will continue to dog her. Asked during a debate why she received $675,000 for three short appearances, she replied: â€œWell, I don't know. Thatâ€™s what they offered.â€

But Trumpâ€™s refusal to release his tax returns â€“â€” along with his evolving answers and lame excuses â€“â€” neutralizes this potential problem for the Clinton campaign.

It is unlikely, but the FBI investigation into Clintonâ€™s possible mishandling of classified information hangs like a cloud over her campaign.

â€œInvestigators have found scant evidence tying Clinton to criminal wrongdoing, although they are still working on the case and charges have not been ruled out,â€ my colleague Ellen Nakashima reported last week. â€œThey have also been interviewing former aides to Clinton, including Cheryl Mills, who served as chief of staff while Clinton was secretary of state. Prosecutors and FBI agents hope to be able to interview Clinton as they try to wrap up the investigation.â€

Among other potential problems identified by supporters in Balz and Gearanâ€™s story today: â€œClintonâ€™s unpopularity with white men, questions about whether her family philanthropic foundation helped donors and friends, and lingering clouds from her tenure at the State Department, including â€¦ the Benghazi attacks in which four Americans were killed and her support for military intervention in Libya.â€

-- Donâ€™t forget, history is not on Hillaryâ€™s side. Since World War II, only once has a party controlled the White House for three consecutive terms. (George H.W. Bush succeeded Ronald Reagan by beating Mike Dukakis in 1988.)

-- Bottom line: Clinton is more likely than not to be president at this time next year, but the election will probably be closer than you think and Trump could actually win if she doesnâ€™t play her cards right.

-- President Obama delivered an aggressive refutation of Trumpism during his commencement address at Rutgers University, calling on graduates to reject politicians who â€œhark back to better days.â€ From Greg Jaffe: â€œHe mocked Trumpâ€™s call to â€Make America Great Again,â€™ saying that there was never a better time to be alive on the planet and in America. College graduation rates were up, he said. Crime rates had dropped, and more women were in the workplace than ever before in the countryâ€™s history â€¦ [He also] slammed Trumpâ€™s proposal to build a wall along the countryâ€™s southern border, saying the world is becoming ever more interconnected and â€building walls wonâ€™t change that.â€™ At one point, clearly referring to Trump and other congressional Republicans who have decried efforts to combat global warming, Obama warned that, 'In politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue. ... Thatâ€™s not challenging political correctness. Thatâ€™s just not knowing what you are talking about.â€™â€

-- â€œObama is expected to begin campaigning for Clinton in earnest as early as June, when she is expected to lock up the nomination,â€ Balz and Gearan report.

-- Trump and Vice President Biden both went to the University of Pennsylvania's commencement ceremony yesterday. David Weigel was there: â€œFor Trump, the ceremony was all about Tiffany Trump, his daughter with ex-wife Marla Maples, who also attended the commencement. Biden was there for his granddaughter Naomi Biden, the first of the family's third generation to graduate from college. â€¦ When some unexpected rain fell, Trump disappeared beneath an umbrella, while Biden kept shaking hands.â€

MORE ON THE REPUBLICAN RACE:

-- A band of exasperated Republicans is actively plotting to draft an independent presidential candidate to keep Trump from the White House BUT those involved concede that such an effort at this late stage is probably futile. Philip Rucker and Robert Costa: â€œThese GOP figures are commissioning private polling, lining up major funding sources and courting potential contenders â€¦ The effort has been sporadic all spring but has intensified significantly in the 10 days since Trump effectively locked up the Republican nomination. ... But these Republicans â€” including [Mitt Romney,] commentators William Kristol and Erick Erickson and strategists Mike Murphy, Stuart Stevens and Rick Wilson â€” are so repulsed by the prospect of Trump as commander in chief that they are desperate to take action. ... and they think they have only a couple of weeks to launch a credible bid."

Their top recruits are Sen. Ben Sasse [who denies interest] and former presidential candidate John Kasich [who today will give his first TV interview since dropping out]. Earlier prospects included former Sen. Tom Coburn, Condoleezza Rice, and even reality-television star and businessman Mark Cuban." Many dismissed the idea as political fantasy: â€œAgain and again, though, these anti-Trump Republicans have heard the same tepid response. ... 'I donâ€™t see it happening,' Cuban wrote in an email."

A potential third-party candidate faces enormous risk. No one wants to be the next Ralph Nader. "The career of the individual would come to an end, and he would have a difficult spot in history for being responsible for putting Clinton in the White House," said Patrick J. Buchanan. There are also formidable logistical hurdles, with deadlines to get on state ballots fast approaching.

Spoiler alert: Some anti-Trump Republicans are downsizing their ambitions to a more focused, state-specific effort. Mike Murphy, who ran the Jeb Bush super PAC, is pushing one such proposal. "Murphy envisions an independent candidate on what he termed â€an honorable missionâ€™ in Colorado, New Hampshire and Ohio â€” three battleground states with relatively lax ballot-access rules. 'Running an anti-Trump protest candidate in a handful of swing states really appeals to me,' Murphy said. 'You could deny Trump the presidency and perhaps help important Senate and other down-ballot races­ by giving another choice to Republican voters who abhor Hillary Clinton and canâ€™t cross the moral line to vote for Trump.'"

-- Reince Priebus said drafting a third-party candidate to run against Trump would be a â€œsuicide missionâ€ that could wreck the party for â€œgenerations.â€ "They can try to hijack another party and get on the ballot, but, look, it's a suicide mission for our country because what it means is that you're throwing down not just eight years of the White House but potentially 100 years on the Supreme Court and wrecking this country for many generations," the RNC chairman said on "Fox News Sunday." "I think it's very dangerous, and there's other ways to get assurances on the things that they're worried about." Priebus praised the approach taken by Paul Ryan, adding that he would be surprised if Ryan did not endorse Trump soon: "I'd be surprised if we didn't get there, not too much longer in the distant future."

-- Meanwhile, Republican activists chose unity over resistance this weekend, with party leaders pressuring the rank-and-file to fall in line behind the presumptive nominee â€“ and even punishing those who refused. Politicoâ€™s Kyle Cheney: In all, nearly 400 delegates were selected Saturday â€“ about one in every six that will fill Clevelandâ€™s convention center in July.

-- Trump warned of another 9/11-like attack if refugees continue to be admitted into the U.S: "Our country has enough difficulty right now without letting the Syrians pour in," Trump said in an interview on the National Border Patrol Council podcast. He also suggested ISIS is â€œpaying for refugeesâ€™ cell phone plansâ€: "Who pays their monthly charges, right? They have cell phones with the flags, the ISIS flags on them."

-- Trump and Clinton are statistically tied in Georgia, according to a general election poll conducted by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: He leads her 45 to 41 percent, within the pollâ€™s 4.26 margin of error, while 13 percent said they were undecided or did not support either candidate.

-- A family grieving the death of an Alabama-born woman has a request for friends and relatives: Don't vote for Trump. From the AP: â€œRelatives of 34-year-old Katherine Michelle Hinds published an obituary Friday in the Opelika-Auburn News that includes the line: â€In lieu of flowers, do not vote for Donald Trump.â€™ Hinds' mother, Susan Pool, says her daughter â€¦ feared for the future of her three young children if he's elected.â€

-- John Boehner will spend late July and all of August on a cross-country bus trip raising money and campaigning for House Republicans, per Politicoâ€™s Jake Sherman: â€œThe trip â€” on Boehnerâ€™s bus, dubbed â€Freedom Oneâ€™ â€” will begin after the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and end Labor Day weekend.â€

-- Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) defended his use of a derogatory term toward Japanese in a cable-news appearance, saying that he was trying to critique the â€œuninformedâ€ views that Trump espouses. From Paul Kane: â€œKing, who supports Trump nominally but is refusing to campaign for him, said that his use of the word â€Japsâ€™ was meant to criticize the presidential candidateâ€™s policy positions as out of line with the â€nuanceâ€™ required to be the leader of the free world and more in line with a working-class man at the end of a bar espousing his worldview.â€

-- â€œIs Ben Carson the worst or the best surrogate of all time? Yes.â€ By Ben Terris: â€œBen Carson, the neurosurgeon turned presidential candidate turned unfiltered pitchman for Trump, now part of his vice presidential search committee, sat in the back of a town car with his wife, Candy. He had just explained that he wanted no role in a Trump administration when news arrived of a new poll naming him as the best-liked of a list of potential running mates. â€œThe most favorably regarded contenders after himself, he was told, were John Kasich, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin and Chris Christie. â€Those are all people on our list,â€™ he said. That the Trump campaign might want its potential VP picks held close to the vest didnâ€™t seem to occur to Carson. Heâ€™s not the type to keep his candid thoughts to himself.â€

Carson says he has no plan to pull a Dick Cheney and suggest himself. Carson understands heâ€™s a lightning rod for controversy, and Trump doesnâ€™t need help sparking fires. â€œHeâ€™s not interested,â€ said business manager Armstrong Williams. And then: â€œBut miracles can happen â€¦ weâ€™ve seen stranger things, right?â€ Yes, yes we have. Not the least of which has been watching Carson say things that would get any other surrogate benched, only to be elevated within the campaign.â€

MORE ON THE DEMOCRATIC RACE:

-- CONVENTION CHAOS: Tensions ran high at the Democratic state convention in Nevada, a foreboding signs for Clinton as she prepares for the national convention in Philadelphia. With Sanders partisans pushing to include delegates who had been ruled ineligible, party leaders adjourned the convention for the day. "But Sanders supporters refused to concede, remaining in the [Paris] casino's ballroom after the event had ended. Eventually, casino security and law enforcement officials entered to force the Democrats out of the space, even turning off the lights to get them to depart," Philip Bump reports.

Why the Sanders supporters were angry: The rules were seen as less favorable to the Vermont senator by his backers, as was the process for picking 12 up-for-grabs delegates to Philadelphia. Sanders supporters were outraged over the exclusion of 56 delegates â€“ enough to swing the majority â€“ who were denied mostly because they weren't registered as Democrats by the May 1 deadline. (Eight Clinton delegates reportedly suffered a similar fate, Las Vegas Sun notes.)

Here are some live tweets from the dean of the Nevada press corps:

-- On the trail in Kentucky, Clinton got more specific about what Bill Clintonâ€™s White House role could be. From Abby Phillip: "I'm going to put [him] in charge of revitalizing the economy because you know, he knows how to do it," she told supporters. "And especially in places like coal country and inner cities and other parts of our country that have been really left out." Clinton, who has long made it clear she looks to her husbandâ€™s presidency as a model for how to manage the economy, often notes the job creation and increases in median household income during his administration. "When my husband was president, incomes rose for everybody," she said in Louisville.

-- Many young Black Lives Matter protestors are not voting, according to exit polling analysis from 25 primaries. From Vanessa Williams and Scott Clement: African Americans account for a larger share of Democratic primary voters than they did in 2008, but that is because of OLDER black voters. Comparing exit polls in 25 states from 2008 and 2016, â€œblack voters older than 45 grew from 12 percent of the electorate on average in 2008 to 16 percent this year. In those same states, black voters younger than 45 made up 11 percent of voters in 2008 vs. 10 percent this year.â€

President Obama, in his commencement address last weekend at Howard University, praised young black activists for bringing new energy to the movement for racial justice and equality, but he said: â€œYou have to have a strategy. Not just awareness, but action. Not just hashtags, but votes.â€ Obamaâ€™s comments echoed continuing concerns that some young black activists involved in the current wave of political action do not share the belief in the critical importance of the right to vote:

Younger Americans are the least likely to turn out in elections: The share of eligible voters ages 18 to 29 who cast ballots fell from a record high of 48 percent in 2008 to 41 percent in the 2012 presidential election, according to the U.S. Elections Project.

Interviews with activists inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement revealed a nuanced view of electoral politics: â€œNone advocated a total boycott of elections â€¦ At the same time, many were not enthusiastic about the value of voting, particularly in this yearâ€™s presidential election cycle. These activists argued that neither candidate had adequately addressed the issues affecting black communities. â€Voting is definitely one way â€¦ but there are other ways of reimagining and restructuring the world, and that lies in organizing our communities,â€™ said Ashley Williams, a 23-year-old activist.â€

-- The RNC chairman defended Trumpâ€™s refusal to release his tax returns: "People don't look at Trump as to whether he releases his taxes," Priebus said on ABC. "People look at Trump and say, 'Is this person going to cause an earthquake in Washington, D.C., and make something happen?' That is it. I don't think the traditional playbook applies â€¦ We've been down this road for a year â€¦ He's rewritten the playbook." (Elise Viebeck)

-- Newt Gingrich again said heâ€™s open to being Trumpâ€™s running-mate: "I don't think it's an automatic yes," Gingrich said on "Fox News Sunday." But â€œIâ€™d be hard-pressed not to say yes." The former Speaker suggested his decision would be based largely on what duties Trump would expect from a running-mate, as well as how â€œseriouslyâ€ he takes the role.

-- Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) demurred when asked if he would serve as Clinton's running-mate. â€œI love the job Iâ€™m doing,â€ Brown told CNNâ€™s Jake Tapper. â€œI will put real effort into electing Hillary â€¦ but as I said, I love this job, and I'm just not going to give you a different answer."

-- Trump senior adviser Paul Manafort denied that Trump ever posed as his own publicist to speak with reporters, saying he believes a 25-year-old audio recording that is clearly Trump is not actually Trump. "I couldn't tell who it is. If Donald Trump says it's not him, I believe it's not him," Manafort said on CNNâ€™s "State of the Union." Manafort also touted the â€œcrossover supportâ€ that his boss has attracted in traditionally Democratic states, arguing that they will â€œexpand the mapâ€ and can win in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio.

Trump and Manafort's denials directly contradict testimony that The Donald gave under oath in a 1990 lawsuit.

On Friday afternoon, Washington Post reporters who were 44 minutes into a phone interview with Trump about his finances asked him a question about Miller: â€œDid you ever employ someone named John Miller as a spokesperson?â€ The phone went silent, then dead. When the reporters called back and reached Trumpâ€™s secretary, she said, â€œI heard you got disconnected. He canâ€™t take the call now. I donâ€™t know what happened.â€ (Read the original story.)

Via Zignal Labs, here is a word cloud of all Trump mentions on Friday:

-- â€œChina killed thousands of Maine jobs. Now itâ€™s eating up the stateâ€™s lobsters,â€ by Ylan Q. Mui: â€œLittle Cranberry, an island of 70 inhabitants, and China, a nation of 1.4 billion people, increasingly find themselves connected by the shifting currents of the world economy. The rise of Chinaâ€™s middle class has coincided with a boom in Maineâ€™s lobster population, resulting in a voracious new market for the crustaceansâ€™ succulent, sweet meat. Exports of lobsters to China, nonexistent a decade ago, totaled $20 million last year. â€¦ The lobsterâ€™s tale is a testament to the complexities of the global marketplace â€” and a reminder that the line between economic winners and losers is not always clear. China has played the villain (in 2016), blamed for â€¦ the disappearance of blue-collar jobs, including in Maine, where the closure of lumber and pulp factories have left thousands of workers unemployed. Yet the reality is more nuanced. Even as foreign competition has devastated parts of the U.S. economy, China ranks among the biggest international customers for a vast array of other industries, from ginseng to airplanes to pork. Maine lobsters are just a tiny sliver of the $116 billion in annual exports to China, a figure that has nearly tripled in the past decade.â€

-- â€œAl-Qaeda affiliates are threatening West Africaâ€™s most peaceful cities,â€ by Kevin Sieff in Dakar: â€œIn a city where nightclubs and mosques coexist peacefully, Islamist violence long felt like a foreign problemâ€”something residents watched on news clips from the Middle East or other parts ofâ€”Africa. But Senegal and its neighbors are facing a new threat from extremists moving far from their traditional strongholds in northwest Africa. Since November, militant groups have killed dozens of people in assaults on hotels, cafes and a beachside resort in West Africa, passing through porous borders with impunity. The attacks have occurred in countries that had been rebounding from political turbulence, such as Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso. Now fears of such bloodshed are growing in this pro-Western democracy, which serves as a regional hub for international organizations. ... Senegal, a former French colony that has never suffered a major terrorist incident, is now taking unprecedented security measures."

-- â€œFilipino children of U.S. sailors and soldiers have mixed feelings on American return,â€ by Emily Rauhala: â€œThereâ€™s a taunt that hangs over this former U.S. naval base, looming over kids who look a little different, shadowing single moms: â€Left by the ship.â€™ The term is used to shame the offspring of U.S. servicemen and local women ... Nearly 25 years ago, Philippine lawmakers expelled the U.S. warships that had docked here for almost a century, vowing to â€unchainâ€™ the country from its colonial past â€¦â€ But for decades, tens of thousands of children of U.S. military men have been fighting not to be forgotten. â€œNow Chinaâ€™s claims to most of the South China Sea have put the Philippines back at the heart of U.S. strategy in Asia. A new defense pact allows the U.S. military to build facilities at five Philippine bases, and a growing number of ships will be stopping by Subic Bay. Their return is renewing questions about what the U.S. owes Filipino Amerasians â€” and stoking worries that there will be more neglected children when the ships leave harbor once again.â€

-- â€œDisagreements slow Pentagonâ€™s plan to allow transgender service members,â€ by Dan Lamothe: â€œMonths before Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said the Pentagon would take steps toward allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military, Army Staff Sgt. Patricia King last year became what she believes is the first openly transgender member of the infantry. While official Pentagon policy still forbids openly transgender personnel, her commanders have been supportive, she said. King even purchased a female dress Army service uniform, anticipating that she would be able to wear it soon. But four months after a deadline set Carter set for a working group to finish evaluating the change, transgender
