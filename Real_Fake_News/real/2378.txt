Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has already spent five years in Taliban captivity, but charging him with desertion would likely lead to no jail time and would send a message to soldiers.

South Korea voted to impeach its president. What happens next?

Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl will be charged with desertion after a months-long review of his disappearance from his Afghanistan outpost that led to his five year-long captivity.

That, at least, is the speculation from Fox News and reportedly confirmed by NBC. The Army denies that any decision has been made.

The reporting â€œis patently false,â€ Maj. Gen. Ronald Lewis, chief of public affairs for the US Army, said in a statement provided to the Monitor Tuesday afternoon. â€œTo be clear, there have been no actions or decisions on the Sgt. Bergdahl investigation.â€

Instead, the investigation is still with the commanding general of US Army Forces Command, Mark Milley, â€œwho will determine appropriate action â€“ which ranges from no further action to convening a court-martial,â€ Major General Lewis added. â€œWe understand the public interest in this case, and once a decision has been made, the Army will be open and transparent in this matter.â€

Judging from the Pentagon hallway chatter that has come in the wake of the reports, however, the notion that the Army would charge Sergeant Bergdahl with desertion makes a great deal of sense to many senior military officials.

So what would the US military hope to gain by charging Bergdahl with desertion? After all, wasnâ€™t his confinement at the hands of the Taliban punishment enough?

â€œI guess it doesnâ€™t surprise me that the Army would be going this route,â€ says a former military official who served as a top judge advocate general (JAG) and spoke on condition of anonymity because he continues to sit on a panel that hears military cases.

â€œI hate to say it like this, but itâ€™s a win-win for everyone,â€ he adds.

Itâ€™s a â€œwinâ€ for the Pentagon, because it sends a strong message desertion is unacceptable.

But there is also a compassionate nod to the hardships Bergdahl endured while in captivity. â€œThe government really isnâ€™t interested in putting him in jail,â€ the former JAG says.

Indeed, if the Army does decide to charge Bergdahl with desertion, he will most likely have the option of requesting a discharge.

With a possible court-martial looming, this discharge would not be honorable, but rather a less-than-honorable discharge.

The Army could refuse Bergdahlâ€™s request for discharge, but this would be â€œhighly unlikely,â€ the former senior JAG says.

â€œIâ€™d be very surprised if they did that. What they want is to have him out of the Army,â€ he says--not the public outcry that would likely come if Bergdahl faced jail time after five years as a Taliban captive.

â€œI think they just want to get rid of them, and to send a strong signal that this type of behavior will not be tolerated.â€

This behavior includes reportedly leaving his combat outpost, Mest-Lalak, in Paktika Province in dangerous eastern Afghanistan in June, 2009.

Bergdahl was returned to the United States after a prisoner swap that was arranged earlier this year.

It is remains unclear whether Bergdahl intended to return to his outpost, or not.
