President Obamaâ€™s appearance at a town hall meeting Thursday night on â€œGuns in Americaâ€ was an orchestrated performance by invitation only. But event, hosted by CNN at George Mason University, saw anchor Anderson Cooper continually surprise the president.

Cooper demonstrated a deft command of the facts related to the gun issue and that came through with his guests and in his questionsâ€”though, as the evening unfolded, he continually let the president get away with untruths about his past positions.

Surprisingly, both sides of the issue were present in the small roomâ€”though, judging by audience applause, most were anti-gun-freedom.

Some of the moments were unintentionally revealing.

Cooper began by asking President Obama if heâ€™d ever owned a gun. Mr. Obama sat up in surprise and said â€œno.â€ But, after a search for words, the president said he shoots skeet sometimes at Camp David before adding that heâ€™s not much â€œof a marksman.â€ When he said that anyone who enjoys the shotgun sports knew he must not have shot skeet much, as â€œmarksmanshipâ€ is a term used for target shooting, not by those who shoot skeet, trap or sporting clays.

When Cooper shifted the discussion to why the president chose to use executive actions on the gun issue, instead of working with Congress, Cooper asked the president if he would meet with the NRA. The president said, â€œIâ€™m happy to meet with the NRA,â€ but as he said it he had this snarky smile on his face that would have been more fitting on one of his late show appearances.

Now, CNN says they invited President Obama to this live â€œtown hallâ€ on guns at George Mason University and that they later invited the NRA. The NRA, however, said theyâ€™d rather not play along with a â€œpublic relations spectacle orchestrated by the White House.â€

The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the trade association for firearms manufacturers, also declined an invitation. Larry Keane, senior vice president and general counsel to the NSSF, told me, â€œWe declined the invitation because it is a White House-orchestrated made-for-TV event and not an opportunity for a genuine dialogue or an effort to find common ground. We remain disappointed that the president has chosen to demagogue the issue for political purposes instead of providing real leadership like working to advance Rep. Tim Murphyâ€™s bipartisan legislation to address the issue of mental health, which is the common denominator in mass shootings.â€

Given Obamaâ€™sâ€”and CNNâ€™sâ€”attacks on the NRA and gun manufacturers in general, it is hard to blame them for passing on the invitation, but in retrospect Cooper might have made them wish they were there to help keep President Obama squirming.

As squirm he didâ€”with the facts and in his seat.

Taya Kyle, the wife of the late â€œAmerican Sniperâ€ Chris Kyle, was the first person Cooper called on. Kyle recently won a gun competition using the latest in sniper technology. She is a confident straight shooter. She pointed out that while the murder rate is at an all-time low, gun ownership is at an all time high. And then she asked, â€œWhy not celebrate who we are?â€

President Obama began shifting on his stool and searching for words to lawyer his way out of these basic facts. He finally pointed out that national trends donâ€™t necessarily hold true in all locales, but he never had to answer why the areas with the strictest gun controls tend to have the highest murder rates.

There was also a rape survivor, Kimberly Corban, who, when called on said, â€œI have been unspeakably vandalized once alreadyâ€ before asking why she shouldnâ€™t be able to carry a gun to protect herself.

President Obama was really uncomfortable then. He began back peddling and said his current executive actions wonâ€™t interfere with her right to carry a gun. But he never had to explain that he has supported bans on concealed-carry permits.

President Obama also repeatedly said that people can â€œjust go on the Internet and buy whatever weapon they want.â€ But he was never forced to explain that any gun bought from a dealer over the Internet has to be sent to a local dealer that by law has to perform a background check before they can transfer the gun.

Later, Cooper actually did challenge President Obama by breaking in and asking â€œis it fair to call it a conspiracyâ€ that people think he wants to take their guns away. â€œYes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy,â€ said President Obama, who then claimed that he isnâ€™t plotting take peoplesâ€™ guns away.

But Cooper didnâ€™t force the president to address his advocacy for a renewed â€œassault weaponsâ€ ban, or for his administrationâ€™s public desire to use black lists, such as the no-fly list, to take away citizensâ€™ Second Amendment rights without giving them even the basics of due process.

There were other questions that took President Obama aback, such as when Sheriff Paul Babue pushed Obama on how his proposals wouldnâ€™t solve recent mass shootings. Cooper even broke in to say that â€œnone of the guns used in recent mass shootings, I should point out, were purchased from legal dealers.â€

President Obama didnâ€™t have a clear answer to say why he isnâ€™t swayed by these facts. He meandered before saying, â€œThe young man who killed those children in Newtown didnâ€™t have a criminal record but he had access to an arsenal.â€ He referred to an attack in China where a person attacked people with a knife and said â€œthe vast majority survived because he wasnâ€™t wielding a semiautomatic.â€

Again, Cooper allowed President Obama to escape an obvious allusion to the fact that he would like to ban semiautomatic firearms.

The president was also allowed to get away with a big lie on â€œsmart-guns.â€

President Obama said, â€œ[Smart Gun technology] has not been developed primarily because it has been blocked by the NRAâ€ and firearms manufacturers.

Cooper didnâ€™t challenge this point and instead called on a person in the audience, which changed the topic.

Nevertheless, this is a clear and provable fabrication by President Obama. As I detail, with interviews with many gun makers, law makers and gun experts in my book â€œThe Future of the Gun,â€ the NRA and the NSSF, to name two pro-Second Amendment groups, have statements on their websites saying they are not opposed to â€œsmart-gunâ€ technology. All the manufacturers, the NRA leadership and more, point to laws that seek to mandate smart-gun technologyâ€”regulations previously backed by the Obama administrationâ€”that are what is impeding smart-gun development. Even â€œ60 Minutesâ€ noted this, and pointed out a New Jersey law on the books that would do this, in a recent report.

President Obama said early on in the town hall event that â€œpeople occupy different realities.â€

Anyone who watched CNNâ€™s â€œGuns in Americaâ€ was certainly left with the conclusion that in Obamaâ€™s chosen reality he wishes he could, with a stroke of his pen, pass European-style gun controls in America.
