Ted Cruz won more delegates than anyone else on Saturday night, further narrowing the race between Trump and Cruz, and weakening Marco Rubio as the race heads to Florida.

Ted Cruz crushed the Kansas and Maine caucuses on â€œSuper Saturdayâ€ while Donald Trump narrowly won the Louisiana and Kentucky prizes. But perhaps the biggest news was Marco Rubio fading in the field to a distant third place, despite racking up major endorsements across the map.

Over the past six weeks, the GOP establishment has moved from denial to anger to bargaining in the stages of grief that have accompanied this outsider election. But with Rubioâ€™s big fade, the Hail Mary of a brokered convention looks even less likely. And whatâ€™s left of the partyâ€™s center-right is heading for the next stage of depression. A hug and a drink are in order, as their party prepares to be wrested away from reform Republicans.

The Florida Republicanâ€”struggling to present himself as the establishment-friendly alternative to Donald Trumpâ€”had perhaps his worst night yet, racking up zero wins, and failing to even snag a second-place finish anywhere.

In fact, Rubio finished third in three of the four states contested on Saturday. And with just 8 percent, the Florida senator fell to fourth in Maineâ€”failing to get the minimum 10 percent necessary to win any delegates.

â€œMarco has to get out of the race. Has to,â€ Trump said.

Thereâ€™s now no question that Rubioâ€™s decision to descend to Trumpâ€™s level of discourse has been a total failure. The attacks on the size of Trumpâ€™s hands, the jokes about him wetting himself, the â€œcon artistâ€ name-calling, have all fallen flat.

And the losses on Saturday could rob his campaign of desperately needed momentum. Rubio has repeatedly stated that he expects to win in his home state of Florida on March 15. And, of course, thatâ€™s technically possible. But he has yet to lead in a single public poll of the state. And he doesnâ€™t want to talk about what heâ€™ll do if Florida doesnâ€™t work out.

The billionaire businessman, with the flair of a pro wrestler, said he hoped for a head-to-head match-up with Cruz.

If Rubio takes Trumpâ€™s advice, then some hot Cruz/Trump one-on-one action could be in our future. Best election ever.
