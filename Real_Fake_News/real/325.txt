The death threats were starting to get to Constantin Querard. They had been streaming in from Donald Trump supporters, who wanted to know why Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) had won delegates at Arizonaâ€™s convention even though Trump had won the state. After the deluge, finally, a nice-seeming message appeared on his Facebook page.

Querard, the Arizona political consultant who had managed Cruzâ€™s delegate campaign, clicked to read the rest.

â€œIâ€™m praying for you to get prostate cancer.â€

Cruzâ€™s delegates were girded for two more months of this, then a contested convention where they could force a second ballot and defeat Trump, making all the hate mail worth it.

Instead, hundreds of Republican activists have been elected as delegates to a convention expected to be a coronation of Trump. Delegates such as Querard, who outfoxed Trump supporters at state conventions, were now trapped on a speeding Trump Train. They were legally bound to stand up and nominate him. That might be the last time they vote for him.

â€œIâ€™m a lifelong Republican and I love the party,â€ said Querard. â€œBut donâ€™t ask me how Iâ€™ll vote in November. Iâ€™ve been on the receiving end of enough death wishes where itâ€™s pretty soon for me to strap on the jersey with any authenticity.â€

There are unhappy delegates at every party convention, but the captive audience of Trump skeptics bound for Cleveland is unique. For months, supporters of Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich worked to get their supporters elected as unbound delegates, or even as â€œTrojan horseâ€ delegates bound to Trump on the first ballot but free to bolt if the contest continued.

For a few weeks, it seemed to be working. Kasich and Cruz both crowed about their ability to out-organize Trumpâ€™s forces, who in Cruzâ€™s world were not â€œcapable to run a lemonade stand.â€ As both men lost high-profile contests â€” Trump won all but two of them, in Utah and Wisconsin, after March 15 â€” Cruz took to counting up his state convention victories as proof that voters were rejecting Trump.

Yet Trump turned the wins against them, telling his mega-rallies that a â€œcrooked dealâ€ was stealing his delegates. Roger Stone, a Trump ally who had promised to publish the names and hotel rooms of â€œTrojan horseâ€ delegates, was happy to see them fail.

â€œMany will not attend, leaving their seats to the alternates, who in most cases are Trump supporters,â€ Stone said. â€œI am not too concerned about their feelings.â€

The people who had out-organized Trump were dazed by the backlash. â€œNorth Dakota did it how it was supposed to be done,â€ said Bette Grande, a hard-charging Cruz delegate who helped him dominate that stateâ€™s weekend convention. â€œThe media didnâ€™t like that because it was something they didnâ€™t understand, so they bought into the lie of Trump that something unfair was going on.â€

Grande, like almost all of the Cruz and Kasich delegates, intended to head to Cleveland anyway. In the days since the Indiana primary, delegates have occasionally sought instructions or solace from the Cruz and Kasich campaigns. There has been no instruction to stand down, and no hint that the results can be overturned.

â€œIt is time for those who supported others in the Republican Party to come together and help Mr. Trump be the best candidate he can be,â€ said Jim Brainard, the mayor of Carmel, Ind., whose election as a pro-Kasich delegate turned out to be one of that campaignâ€™s last coups. â€œItâ€™s a big tent, and those of us who disagree with Trump will hopefully have an opportunity to sway his views.â€

Some of the â€œTrojan horsesâ€ had only reluctantly backed Cruz or Kasich. Subba Kolla, a Realtor from Northern Virginia, had backed Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) in the stateâ€™s close primary, but allied with Cruz during the state convention. Cruzâ€™s forces won a smashing victory, but Kolla was resigned to backing Trump.

â€œIâ€™m not sad,â€ he said. â€œI am a party loyalist. I am representing my community, the Indian American community, and I donâ€™t want to disappoint them. Most of our community supported Rubio. Now thereâ€™s only Trump. I donâ€™t have any bad feelings about him.â€

Several other delegates said that they would attend to keep Trump and the GOP honest. Virginia state Sen. Richard H. Black (Loudoun), a Cruz delegate, said he had actually preferred Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerica firstâ€ policy to Cruzâ€™s, but intended to go to Cleveland and defend the social conservative planks of the Republican platform.

Kay Godwin, a Georgia conservative who had become a Cruz delegate, felt the same way. â€œIt wasnâ€™t the Lordâ€™s plan for Ted to win, but maybe thatâ€™ll be his plan next time,â€ she said. â€œThe reason I became a Republican is because the platform is wonderful. It stands for everything that I stand for in my heart.â€

Still, there were holdouts. Querard knew of one alternate who no longer wanted to spend the money to go to Cleveland. Russell Donley, a former speaker of the Wyoming House who had won one of Cruzâ€™s slots, said the Trump victory made him inclined to stay home with his wife.

â€œIf Trumpâ€™s short one vote, and thereâ€™s an opening for Cruz, okay, then I go,â€ Donley said. â€œBut Iâ€™m an old Wyoming boy, and going to Cleveland in the summer doesnâ€™t really enthuse me.â€

Then there was Eric Brakey, a young state senator from Maine who had been part of a Cruz slate that triumphed so resoundingly that Gov. Paul LePage (R) denounced it. Four years earlier, Brakey had fought just as hard to become a delegate for former Texas congressman Ron Paul, only to watch the Republican National Committee overturn the state convention and replace some Paul delegates with Romney delegates. This year, Brakey was finally given a vote at the convention â€” and received yet another disappointment.

â€œDonald Trump isnâ€™t who my conscience tells me to support,â€ Brakey said. â€œThen again, neither was Ted Cruz. I voted for Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) at the caucuses, and when I ran for delegate I said I would reflect the will of the voters. Now Iâ€™m sort of jokingly telling people that Iâ€™ll cast my vote for Ron Paul â€” four years late.â€
