This is true at both the national and state levels. Modern conservative mythology begins with Reagan, a man who tripled the federal budget deficit (which shot up to $3 trillion during his tenure) and raised taxes 11 times during the course of his presidency. Reagan didnâ€™t shrink the size of government or grow the middle class. On the contrary, he made government more bloated, more defense-oriented, more corporatist. George W. Bushâ€™s 8 years in office were similarly disastrous: more corporate welfare, more debt, more Utopian military campaigns, more disorder.

Today Republican governors are plunging â€“ or have plunged â€“ their states into one abyss after another, all under the banner of conservatism. There are almost too many examples to cite: Sam Brownback in Kansas; Bobby Jindal in Louisiana; Rick Snyder in Michigan; Phil Bryant in Mississippi; Scott Walker in Wisconsin; Chris Christie in New Jersey; Paul LePage in Maine; Rick Scott in Florida. The list goes on and on and on.

The point is obvious enough: The conservative brand is tainted.

Now that Donald Trump has hijacked the Republican Party, the conservative intelligentsia is apoplectic. Trump isnâ€™t a real conservative, they say. Heâ€™s ideologically incoherent, they say. The assumption is that Trump is an aberration, a chimera born of anti-establishment rage. Or that heâ€™s a threat to the â€œconservative movementâ€ rather than its natural outgrowth.

Consider the latest Wall Street Journal op-ed by conservative columnist Bret Stephens. Stephens writes:

There are two problems with this. First, thereâ€™s a disconnect between establishment Republicans and conservative voters. If you watch Fox News or listen to right-wing radio, itâ€™s clear that the base isnâ€™t animated by a coherent worldview. Many self-identify as conservative, but their conservatism is a vague stew of cultural resentment, religious certainty, and half-baked talking points. There is no consistent â€œconservative causeâ€ to preserve. And if there is a genuine conservative coalition, the Know Nothings and the John Birchers are now central to it. Indeed, the GOP has cultivated these wings since its adoption of the â€œSouthern Strategyâ€ roughly 50 years ago.

Second, to the extent that conservative ideas have been implemented in recent years, they havenâ€™t worked. The â€œconservative causeâ€ is already crippled. Neoliberal economics, which is what conservative elites support, has gutted the country and the working class. The trade deals, the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, the privatization schemes â€“ have redistributed wealth upwards at the expense of everyone else. â€œConservatives,â€ Stephens writes, are â€œsupposed to believe that itâ€™s folly to put hope before experience,â€ but theyâ€™ve put ideological dogma over empirical reality for decades. â€œTrickle-downâ€ economics didnâ€™t work for Reagan (revenue decreased and unemployment spiked to 10.8 percent after his initial 1981 tax cuts, for example) and it didnâ€™t work for the Bush administrations. And yet GOP presidential candidates speak as though the contrary were true, as though history doesnâ€™t exist. One can argue that this isnâ€™t classical conservatism; that real conservatism involves prudence, a pragmatic respect for existing institutions, and careful responsiveness to change. But thatâ€™s not what passes as conservatism. Todayâ€™s â€œconservativesâ€ are hopelessly wedded to discredited abstractions. When elected, their ideas have failed. Now voters are revolting against the establishment and choosing instead to embrace the ethno-nationalism of Trump. Stephens writes that â€œA Trump presidency means losing the Republican Party.â€ I disagree. Trumpâ€™s nomination means the Republican Party is already lost. Or perhaps it was never found. The GOP has been ideologically fractured since at least the early â€™80s, when it morphed into a quasi-religious movement. The Wall Street Journal editorial board cares about tax policy and capital gains, but the Republican base doesnâ€™t. The people voting for Trump are losers in the new economy to be sure, but theyâ€™re animated by cultural angst and identity-based fears as much as anything else. Republicans have exploited their base in similar ways for years; Trump has just taken it to another level. Iâ€™m not sure what a Trump presidency really means. But itâ€™s not the death knell for conservatism. The GOP ruined conservatism long before Trump. If people like Stephens want to save conservatism, they need a new party, not a new candidate.
