The Republican presidential candidates and the far-right echo chamber have made â€œpolitically correctâ€ an all-purpose dismissal for facts and opinions they donâ€™t want to hear.

Take Donald Trumpâ€™s claim that when the World Trade Center towers collapsed on 9/11, â€œI watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering.â€

The Postâ€™s Fact Checker columnist, Glenn Kessler, found no evidence to support Trumpâ€™s claim and gave him Four Pinocchios, reserved for the most baldfaced lies. PolitiFact gave the statement a Pants on Fire rating, denoting extreme mendacity. But when ABCâ€™s George Stephanopoulos pressed the GOP front-runner to explain himself, noting that â€œpolice say it didnâ€™t happen,â€ Trump resorted to what has become a familiar dodge.

â€œI know it might not be politically correct for you to talk about it, but there were people cheering as that building came down,â€ Trump said.

Ben Carson, running second in the national polls, is even more fond of the political-correctness allegation â€” so much so that it could be considered a central theme of his campaign. It is unclear whether he actually knows or cares what â€œpolitical correctnessâ€ means. The phrase is just more verbal romaine to add to the word salad that is Carsonâ€™s discourse.

He used it when challenged on his stance that a Muslim should not be president, even though the Constitution explicitly states there can be no â€œreligious testâ€ for public office. â€œPolitical correctness is imposed by the secular progressives and those who wish to fundamentally change our society,â€ he said. â€œTherefore, they make things off-limits to talk about, but you know what? Iâ€™m going to talk about it anyway.â€

In other words, he considers the framers of the Constitution a bunch of â€œsecular progressives,â€ since theyâ€™re the ones who put a candidateâ€™s faith off-limits. Thatâ€™s not the loopiest thing Carson has said (his attempts to discuss financial reform are in a class of their own) but itâ€™s in the top 10.

The renowned neurosurgeon took the same route Sunday when Stephanopoulos â€” who had a busy morning â€” asked him to react to Trumpâ€™s call for the United States to resume harsh interrogation techniques for terrorism suspects, including waterboarding.

â€œI agree that thereâ€™s no such thing as political correctness when youâ€™re fighting an enemy who wants to destroy you and everything that you have anything to do with,â€ Carson said. â€œAnd Iâ€™m not one who is real big on telling the enemy what weâ€™re going to do and what weâ€™re not going to do.â€

But Carson is a medical doctor who took an oath to heal and alleviate suffering. Or maybe he believes that Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine, was just another PC lemming, blindly following the secular progressives who are leading us to our collective doom.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, asked about his view that the United States should accept no Syrian refugees, said we should not bow to â€œpolitical correctness, the elites in Washington or the editorial pages of major newspapers.â€ Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), asked this summer whether he thought the term â€œanchor baby â€ was offensive, told reporters â€œwe need to stop this politically correct nonsense.â€ Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, after making a joke about transgender people that some found offensive, responded that â€œeverybody wants to be politically correct, everybody wants to be loved by the media and loved by the left and loved by the elitists.â€

And itâ€™s not just GOP candidates who have the anti-political-correctness bug. Many conservative commentators have been quick to condemn the â€œpolitically correctâ€ Princeton University students who demand that the school remove symbols honoring Woodrow Wilson â€” a onetime Princeton president â€” because of his racism.

These critics ignore the historical fact that Wilson was racist not just by todayâ€™s standards but by those of his time. He wrote that African Americans were an â€œignorant and inferior race.â€ He lavishly praised the Ku Klux Klan and pined for the Confederacy. As president of the United States, he ordered that integrated federal government workplaces be segregated; NAACP founder W.E.B. Du Bois wrote of one black clerk who â€œhad a cage built around him to separate him from his white companions.â€

Yes, Iâ€™m being politically correct. But also truthful.
