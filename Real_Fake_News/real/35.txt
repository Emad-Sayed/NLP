GOP opposes the kind of antitrust regulation that would preserve freedom of expression online.

Americaâ€™s right wing is in a froth about allegations that Facebook has tweaked its â€œtrending newsâ€ feed to reduce the visibility of conservative news sites.

Itâ€™s not clear if the allegations, from a Gizmodo report based on anonymous sources, are true and Facebook denies them. But the deeper problem is undeniably real: Facebook is the dominant member of a small number of giant entities â€” corporate and governmental â€” that are gaining control over news, freedom of expression and much of our digital lives. The irony is that the conservatives and business-backed Republicans in Congress who howl about Facebook are the same people who have thwarted policies that would encourage the competition we need to challenge that increasingly centralized control.

Almost no one wants to address the fact that Facebook is becoming a monopoly in the antitrust sense of the word. Along with Google, it dominates online advertising; Facebook especially does so on mobile devices, which are the way many people connect to the Internet. If you offer news and information online, you have almost no choice but to play on Facebookâ€™s field because so much of your audience is there. (In some parts of the world, Facebook essentially is the Internet, because mobile devices are pretty much the sole means of online access and in some cases the company has made deals with local telecommunications companies and, or governments.)

Facebook has been buying everything that presents even a whiff of competition: Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus. This is smart â€” no one can dispute that Mark Zuckerberg and the others on his team are brilliant technologists and strategists â€” but itâ€™s also a red flag. As Zuckerberg famously said several years ago, he wants Facebook to be â€œlike electricity.â€ Well, electricity is a utility. And we regulate utilities.

Monopolies and cozy oligopolies never turn out well in the long run for anyone but the monopolists or cartel members. They end up controlling markets and do their best to thwart genuine competition. Itâ€™s their nature. Which is why capitalism, plainly the best system when itâ€™s working right, needs rules to promote competition.

Yet Republicans, in general, think the government should play little to no role in promoting competition. They consider antitrust inquiry and enforcement to be counterproductive, at best â€” except, of course, when a powerful constituent (a corporation, usually) is in danger from predatory behavior.

That attitude accounts for the GOPâ€™s cheerleading for corporate dominance of Internet access. Republicans, in general, are fine with the idea that one or two companies (say the leading cable provider and another telecom) should control access in most communities, and utterly opposed to a remedy â€” what we call network neutrality â€” to ensure that people at the edges of networks, not dominant Internet service providers, should decide what information they want and at what priority.

I donâ€™t want the government to tell Facebook what it can publish and donâ€™t look forward to much more than posturing from Congress. But I do want the government to start paying extremely close attention to the way the company is becoming a monopoly and to what it means for freedom of expression when a single company has so much power over what people say online. I want government to use antitrust and other pro-competition laws to ensure that Facebook doesnâ€™t abuse its dominance in a business sense. I want government(s) to promote open technology and communications, and fierce competition at every level. Kudos to Zuckerberg for making Facebook so appealing to millions of users; thatâ€™s an amazing achievement. But we canâ€™t allow Facebook to leverage that success to block the emergence of alternatives to its service, or use its market power to influence or alter the content of publications and others trying to communicate with Facebook users.

We all need to wake up to the potential threat Facebook poses to freedom of expression. Once you are in its enclosed online space, it is the corporationâ€™s terms of service, not the First Amendment, that determines what you can say. If it decides to downplay speech it doesnâ€™t like, Facebook has the right to do so.

So Iâ€™m glad that conservatives are concerned, even if the allegations prove overblown. (Facebook has modified its outright denial to a â€œweâ€™re looking into itâ€ stance; stay tuned.) Iâ€™d be even happier if conservatives realized that government does have a role in promoting genuine competition â€” and that weâ€™re in uncharted information-freedom territory under the new control freaks of Silicon Valley.
