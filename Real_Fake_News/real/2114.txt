President Barack Obama said former Secretary of State Hillary Clintonâ€™s use of a personal email server was a mistake, but that U.S. national security hadnâ€™t been endangered. In his first extensive remarks on the controversy that has roiled the Democratic presidential primary, Mr. Obama said on CBSâ€™s â€œ60 Minutesâ€ program that questions about Mrs. Clintonâ€™s email arrangement were legitimate. â€œIt is important for her to answer these questions to the satisfaction of the American public,â€ Mr. Obama said.
