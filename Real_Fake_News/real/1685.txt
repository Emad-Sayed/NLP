Marco Rubio was on a mission on Thursday night: Destroy The Donald. How much damage did he really do?

The Florida senator delivered what was easily his best debate performance yet Thursday night, hammering frontrunner Donald Trump repeatedly on his character, his business record, and his claims to being a conservative. It was the performance he needed. The question now is whether it will matter at all.

Fresh off a three-state winning streak, Trump is close to being anointed the Presumptive Nominee by the media. With just days to go before the crucial sting of Super Tuesday primaries, Trump appears to be leading in most if not every state on the verge of a contest. He has the momentum. He has the math on his side.

â€œIn 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship,â€ Rubio said. â€œIn 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation. And so even today, we saw a report... that Donald, youâ€™ve hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.â€ Rubio then referenced Trumpâ€™s use of Polish workers to construct Trump Tower, which cost the real estate mogul a major settlement in the early 1980s.

â€œMy mom was a maid at a hotel,â€ Rubio continued. â€œAnd instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead. So I think this is an important issue. And I think we are realizing that itâ€™s an important issue for the country thatâ€™s been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all.â€

Trump continued, â€œAs far as the people Iâ€™ve hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help. Itâ€™s the up season. People didnâ€™t want to have part-time jobs. They were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldnâ€™t get. Everybody agrees with me on that. They were part-time jobs. You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldnâ€™t get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.â€

Trump, who had yet to really be attacked by Rubioâ€”or, really, anyone elseâ€”this way, didnâ€™t have much of a response when put on the spot. Trump seemed caught off guard by a candidate with whom heâ€™d enjoyed a kind of d©tente for some time.

â€œItâ€™s not a sound bite,â€ Rubio said, sticking to his guns. â€œItâ€™s a fact. Again, go online and Google it. Donald Trump, Polish workers. The second thing about the trade war, I donâ€™t understand, because your clothes and the ties you wear are made in Mexico and in China. Youâ€™ll be starting a trade war against your own clothes and suits.â€

The old political rule is to attack your enemyâ€™s strengths. And thatâ€™s exactly what Rubio was doing. Trump has framed himself as a brilliant businessman animated by his concern for the common man, the little guy, the silent majority. Heâ€™s never marketed himself as an orthodox conservative, but thatâ€™s where his opponents have hit him again and again with no result.

But Rubio tried something different with his attacks Thursday night. He tried to prove Trump is a huckster, a charlatan who doesnâ€™t know what heâ€™s talking about when pressed for specifics, a trust-fund baby looking to rip off hard-working Americans in order to make a dishonest buck. It went to the heart of Trumpâ€™s appeal, and for that reason it just might stick.

Rubio looked and sounded different from how weâ€™ve ever seen him. But so did Trump. For a man who makes so many facial expressions, he rarely displays any recognizable human emotion, preferring instead to stay aloof and dismissive. Thursday night was different. He was, at turns, deeply frustrated and consumed by abject terror. Things were going very wrong, very quicklyâ€”and right before his squinty eyes.

Trump let out an exhausted sigh. His head seemed to sink into his shoulder pads. He grabbed the microphone with his left hand and wagged his finger with Rubio with his right. â€œNo, no. Iâ€™m the only one on this stage thatâ€™s hired people,â€ he threw his arms out, â€œyou havenâ€™t hired anybody.â€

After Trump reminded the audience that Rubio had recently been roasted by erstwhile candidate Chris Christie, Rubio pressed Trump for specifics on his health-care plan. Trump talked in circles, claiming he would magically create competition by â€œremovingâ€ the â€œlines around the states,â€ and then claiming it over and over again.

The audience cheered. They got the jokeâ€”Rubioâ€™s robot reputation stems from his habit, most clearly shown at his disastrous pre-New Hampshire primary debate, of hewing to his talking points when flustered. Trump stuck his finger in the air in defiance, â€œno, no, no!â€ he said, â€œno no no! I donâ€™t repeat myself! I donâ€™t repeat myself!â€
