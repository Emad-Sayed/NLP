"We ask that everything be done with dignity. There will be no backpacks, fanny packs or cameras. This is for security purposes," a man doing crowd control at the church told the swarm of people assembled near the door.

Church members were given priority among a crowd that included mostly visitors and press. Women were allowed in first in a show of chivalry but also for security. "We will be checking pocketbooks," announced one usher.

Before long, the organist began playing "Amazing Grace" followed by "What a Friend We Have in Jesus". The choir, dressed in all white began the service, by singing "Total Praise", a gospel song that brought the crowd to its feet.

"We are reminded this morning of the freshness of death. It comes like a thief in the night," said Norvel Goff, reverend and presiding elder of the African Methodist Episcopal district that includes Emanuel. Goff called congregants to the altar to pray. "Many of our hearts are still broken. Many of us are still shedding tears. But we must take our burdens to the Lord and leave them there."

Goff continued, "As we try to make sense of nonsense, pray for our children. We pray that God will give us the clarity of thought to share with them what God has shared with us."

One man erupted in tears on the way back to his seat repeating over and over, "This is just an unthinkable tragedy. Help us, God."

Calvary preaches many things, including the inevitable rapture, the second coming of Jesus, and the â€œmonogamous marriage between male and female as the foundation of the family.â€ The majority of the few dozen in attendance on Sunday were white.

â€œThis is what anger and hate against the church looks like,â€ Pastor Richard Perea said of the killings. â€œThe liberal media must now care about church in a way they have not before.â€

Sundayâ€™s sermon focused mostly on Bible study, going line-by-line through Biblical verses much in the same way "The Beautiful 9" at Emanuel did before alleged mass murderer Dylann Roof turned a gun on them.

â€œI donâ€™t think it has anything to do with religion, not at all,â€ Ashworth said, adding that in this time of tragedy, more people need to pray.

â€œIt was obviously a race issue in his heart,â€ Perea told HuffPost. â€œBut why he went into a church versus down in the street, in my opinion, is something that was demonically influenced.â€

â€œAfter everything thatâ€™s happened in the past week, coming to church means that God is still sovereign,â€ Brooks said. â€œHe still gives us this freedom to come and not be afraid even when people are prejudiced with hate in their heart.â€

When service was over at Emanuel A.M.E., parishioners were greeted by a sea of support from members of the community. Some people handed out bottles of water and cookies to churchgoers as they left the building. Others just shared kind words and hugs.

Jack Logan, 52, the founder of a Put Down the Guns Now, a nonprofit based in South Carolina that is dedicated to reducing gun violence among young people, said he attended the service at Emanuel A.M.E. for that feeling of connection.

 

 â€œThis was a tragedy for South Carolina, and America,â€ Logan said. â€œI wanted to come down here, show love and take part in this great church service today.â€

Another visitor, 28-year-old Ryan Shepard, a court clerk, drove to Charleston from Atlanta just to be at Emanuelâ€™s first church service since Wednesdayâ€™s tragedy.

 

 â€œI think weâ€™re in an important point in American history as it relates to race relations and facing some of the darker chapters of our nationâ€™s past that we havenâ€™t reconciled,â€ Shepard said. â€œI wanted to be present and a part of this mourning process, to witness and support the community here.â€
