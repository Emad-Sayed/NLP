First of all, poor Melania. She was just trying to do her part and get the hell out of there. She deviated not a word from the teleprompter, except when thrown by unfamiliar wordsâ€”like when â€œadversariesâ€ came out as â€œadvisories.â€ Hey, theyâ€™re similar.

Second of all, how the hell does this even happen? Watch the video of Melania and Michelle Obama superimposed upon each other, and you get a sense of how audacious the theft was and how perfect-for-TV this brouhaha is. If someone wrote the speech for Melania, how did that person get hired? And if Melania wrote it herself, who let that happen? (Rule for first gentlemen and first ladies: do not pick your own words.)

In case you missed it, Iâ€™m referring to the Melania-Michelle plagiarism flapâ€”that Melania lifted some paragraphs out of Michelle Obamaâ€™s 2008 convention speech. It is a major embarrassment to the Trump campaign and, without doubt, to Melania. That said, letâ€™s not exaggerate its importance. Writing in The New Republic, Brian Beutler called it â€œincredibly damagingâ€â€”which seems over the top. Itâ€™s devouring the oxygen right now. In 24 hours, it wonâ€™t be.

Every scandal has a half-life. The worst scandals brand you forever and keep unfolding forever. The least serious get forgotten fast and run out of gas in a day. I think Melaniaâ€™s is of the latter sort.

To brand you forever, a scandal needs to reveal something hugely distasteful. This wasnâ€™t that big a deal. Sheâ€™s Donaldâ€™s wife, not Donald. To keep unfolding forever, a scandal needs to have an interesting mystery. This isnâ€™t that interesting or mysterious. The question of how this blunder happened is worth a story, but not a lot of stories.

Contrast this with the scandal of erstwhile Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who allegedly yanked a female reporterâ€™s arm in a boorish manner. That kept going and going because the allegations were very distasteful (assault!) and the mystery was interesting (did he really do it as claimed?). Every couple of days or so, it seemed, a new video emerged. It was an excellent dumb scandal.

Plagiarism is one of those sins that doom journalists but not politicians or their wives. In 1987, when running for president, Joe Biden plagiarized vast passages from Labour Party politician Neil Kinnock, which made for humiliating coverage. In 2008, Barack Obama lifted passages from Massachusetts then-governor Deval Patrick, a misstep that Obama smoothly batted away by saying Patrick had suggested the lines because of the two menâ€™s shared philosophy. Both men did okay in the long run.

So this will damage Trump a little but not much. The pearl-clutching is taking place in newsrooms, not in Americaâ€™s living rooms. Itâ€™s embarrassing, but it plays into no popularly accepted narrative. (That Trumpâ€™s campaign is bumbling and chaotic in its operations is known to political buffs but not the broader public.) Tomorrow, weâ€™ll be arguing about some other snafu. And, the way things are going, weâ€™ll have more than a few to choose from.
