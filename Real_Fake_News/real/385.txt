Embarrassing and infuriating: the NBC anchorâ€™s â€misstatementsâ€™ reveal much about Americaâ€™s media environment.

By now, it may be time to paraphrase a famous remark by Rep. Mo Udall at an endless political dinner and conclude that, â€œEverything that can be said about Brian Williams has been said; itâ€™s just that not everyone has said it yet.â€

Consider what follows as a few footnotes to the Big Stuffâ€”â€œWhy did he do it?â€ â€œHow bad were his misdeeds?â€ â€œAre there others?â€ â€œCan he survive?â€ In the reactions to the story of the Flak Attack That Wasnâ€™t lie some telling realities about todayâ€™s media world.

There Is No â€œWall of Silence.â€ My Twitter feed wasâ€”and still isâ€”filed with assertions that the mainstream media will circle the wagons to protect one of their own. This is precisely what has not happened. The New York Times has published accounts that cast serious doubt not only on Williamsâ€™s later storytelling, but also on the original NBC story 12 years ago. Maureen Dowdâ€™s Sunday column is brutal, reporting concerns within NBC News of Williamsâ€™s tendency to aggrandize himself. In The New Yorker, satirist Andy Borowitz wrote an acidic â€œdiaryâ€ painting the NBC anchor as the embodiment of upper-class privilege. The Washington Post, CNN, Slate and The Daily Beastâ€”media outlets that would never be confused with right-wing zealotryâ€”have been highly critical of Williams. Only a few familiar facesâ€”Dan Rather and TIMEâ€™s Joe Kleinâ€”have spoken up in Williamsâ€™s defense.

You can argue that these outlets been â€œforcedâ€ into this because the digital world makes it impossible to ignore the depredations of traditional media. Or you can note that the media themselves have come to accept that they need to be subject to the same critical gaze as other institutions. Thus the birth of ombudsmen and public accountabilityâ€”from The New York Times and Jayson Blairâ€™s tall tales, to the Washington Postâ€™s Janet Cooke and her eight-year-old addict, to CBS and the George W. Bush National Guard story, to CNNâ€™s Tailwind scandal and beyond. Whatever the reason, the notion that the â€œmainstream mediaâ€ has rushed to protect Brian Williams is laughable.

Williams Made Himself A Perfect Target. Thereâ€™s no more attractive story than one suggesting that an important or powerful figure is a hypocrite. Itâ€™s the war hawk urging the dispatch of young men and women into harmâ€™s way, but whose draft deferments or sketchy medical condition exempted him from the draft. Itâ€™s the liberal voting to bus children to school while sending her kids to private academies. Itâ€™s the tribune of moral virtue paying for abortions for the staff assistant he knocked up. Itâ€™s the environmentalists flying to a climate change rally in a private jet.

Brian Williams is, in this sense, a perfect fit. His inaccurate, or misleading, or deeply dishonest account of what happened in Iraq seems to put the lie to a career that has featured him in the midst of one danger or another. To be clear on this point: Williams in fact has been in many places where natural disasters or violence have indeed involved risk. (I write as someone who, in more than 30 years of network TV reporting, found himself in physical danger exactly once, in South Africa, for a period of perhaps 15 minutes.)

But by steadily exaggerating the perils of his helicopter journey, heâ€™s permitted critics to suggest that it was all an act; that he is not who he wanted us to think he is. Heâ€™s also opened the door to those who scoff at the danger journalists face. On Thursday, Rush Limbaugh scornfully referred to journalists who â€œput on a trench coat and stand in a street in Beirut.â€ This is a slanderous smear on the critically wounded Bob Woodruff and Kimberly Dozier, on Mike Kelly and David Bloom (who died in Iraq), on James Foley and other journalists beheaded by ISIS, on the 61 journalists killed in 2014. It is, however, a slander that will resonate, and it will resonate because Williams was apparently unwilling to let his record, unvarnished, speak for itself.

Have You Looked In the Mirror Lately? Brian Williams is one of many in the mainstream or traditional or legacy media who have warned about the difficulty of judging the credibility of â€œnew media.â€ When a story is coming from somewhere â€œout there,â€ in the digital universe, with no imprimatur, whereâ€™s the institutional backup, where are the researchers, the editors, the fact-checkers, the accountability?

Well, in this case, it was the toolbox of the â€œnew mediaâ€ that exposed the holes (or lack of them) in the helicopter story. Facebook gave a member of the U.S. military the forum on which to challenge Williams (â€œSorry, dude, I don't remember you being on my aircraftâ€). Moreover, there are a lot of questions still to be answered about why the NBC staffers who were with Williams never raised their voices to say: â€œUm Brian, about that storyâ€¦â€

As for what happens next: I donâ€™t know what NBCâ€”or outside investigatorsâ€”are going to find. I donâ€™t know if it makes sense (assuming no other transgressions) for Williams to sit down with a smart, tough but fair inquisitorâ€”Megyn Kelly? Jon Stewart? The scheduled appearance on Letterman Thursday?â€”and answer whatever questions are thrown his way. It probably makes sense for Williams to shelve his considerable comedic gifts and stay away from Jimmy Fallon and Saturday Night Live.

I do know that thereâ€™s one idea that struck me as eminently on point. It comes from Matt Dowd, the recovering political operative and ABC News analyst, who tweeted: â€œMaybe [the] news media can learn from this episode and start being a little more compassionate when others mess up.â€
