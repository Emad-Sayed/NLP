WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. â€” Not to be outdone by her Republican rival, Hillary Clinton fired off a series of early-morning messages Saturday  on Twitter.

Only the tweets sent over the Democratic presidential nomineeâ€™s account dealt with a very different subject matter than those blasted about a former beauty-pageant winner by Donald Trump 24 hours before.

Clinton instead focused on national service, a subject to which she had devoted a speech in Florida on Friday.

â€œIt's 3:20am. As good a time as any to tweet about national service,â€ said the first one, coming at the same time that Trump started his storm of disparaging tweets about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.

The next Clinton tweet borrowed a favorite word of Trump.

â€œThere are hundreds of thousands more @AmeriCorps applications than spots. Horrible!â€ it read. â€œLet's expand it from 75,000 annual members to 250,000.â€

The tweets â€” several more followed â€” were the latest bid by Clinton to keep a spotlight on what she described Friday as Trump coming â€œunhinged.â€

In his tweets, the Republican presidential nominee called Machado â€œdisgustingâ€ and a â€œconâ€ and raised questions about her past, alleging she had been in a sex tape.

The former Miss Universeâ€™s story has dominated media coverage of the election since Clinton brought her up at Mondayâ€™s debate, when she criticized Trump for denigrating comments he made in 1996 about Machadoâ€™s weight.

Unlike Trump, who often tweets himself, many of those sent out over Clintonâ€™s official campaign account are composed by aides.

On Friday, there were a series mocking Trumpâ€™s behavior, and at a rally in Coral Springs, Fla., she accused her rival of having a â€œmeltdown.â€

Trumpâ€™s twitter account appeared to have been silent in the early-morning hours on Saturday.
