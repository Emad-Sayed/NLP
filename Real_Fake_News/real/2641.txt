What sort of man is lurking deep inside Donald Trumpâ€™s innards?

We were led to believe that Mr. Trump was one of us -- a conservative of the gun-toting, Bible-clinging variety.

But friends, Mr. Trump is no conservative. His talk is far different from his walk.

Fox News confirms that senior campaign aides assured Republicans in private that the Trump weâ€™ve seen on the campaign trail is not going to be the same Trump we get in the White House.

â€œWhen heâ€™s out on that stage, when heâ€™s talking about the kinds of things heâ€™s talking about on the stump, heâ€™s projecting an image thatâ€™s for that purpose,â€ Trump strategist Paul Manafort said behind closed doors.

â€œYouâ€™ll start to see more depth of the person, the real person,â€ he added. â€œYouâ€™ll see a real different guy.â€

The Associated Press reported that Trumpâ€™s aides mentioned the need to â€œmoderate his brash personality.â€

â€œThe part that heâ€™s been playing is evolving into the part that now youâ€™ve been expected, but he wasnâ€™t ready for, because he had first to complete the first phase,â€ Manifold said. â€œThe image is going to change.â€

Back in the South those are code words for snookered, two-faced and phony-as-a-two-dollar-bill.

Oh, Donald. What have you done? Say it isnâ€™t so.

â€œDonald Trump is telling the American people that heâ€™s lying to us,â€ Sen. Ted Cruz said on the campaign trail Friday. â€œHis campaign is now run by Washington lobbyists.â€

If true, Mr. Trump is no different than the Establishment Republicans who so effortlessly betrayed and abandoned the base of the party.

The man is campaigning as a conservative â€” but Iâ€™d be willing to bet a pair of Corinthians that heâ€™s secretly plotting to govern as a liberal.

So the question must be asked. When will we see the â€œrealâ€ Donald Trump?

Will he still send the illegals back from whence they came? Will he still make Mexico pay for the wall? Will he really bring jobs back to the United States? Will he defend the American working man?

And what does it mean when his campaign says he will â€œmoderateâ€ his message?

Mr. Trump promised to â€œMake America Great Again.â€ Does he really mean that â€” or does he just want to â€œMake America Averageâ€?

In just the past few days weâ€™ve seen him begin to waffle on issues like abortion and religious liberty.

Pro-life groups are extremely concerned by comments he made about rewriting the partyâ€™s pro-life platform.

He also spoke out against North Carolinaâ€™s decision to strike down Charlotteâ€™s so-called bathroom bill.

â€œThe problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife and the economic punishment that theyâ€™re taking,â€ he said on the "Today Show."



With all due respect, the problem in North Carolina was big business trying to bully and intimidate moms and dads who want to protect their daughters.

â€œIn the last 48 hours, Donald Trump has come out for grown men going into the bathrooms with little girls,â€ Cruz said. â€œThat is politically correctness on steroids.â€

In the Broadway musical, â€œThe Music Manâ€ the good-hearted people of River City got snookered by a fast-talking swindler named Harold Hill.

Hill enthralled the town folk with tales of depravity â€“ of a culture gone astray. Thereâ€™s trouble in River City, he famously proclaimed. Trouble with a capital â€œTâ€.

He promised that he had the cure for what ailed their town â€” and they bought what he was selling hook, line and sinker.

And Iâ€™m afraid conservatives have suffered the same fate as the good people of River City.
