Sen. Rand Paul said Saturday that he thinks the issue of sexuality is one that should be left behind closed doors.

â€œAnd I think if we did a little more of that then maybe the law doesnâ€™t have to engage in stuff thatâ€™s really personal, and the law could be more neutral, but I think the law ought to be fair to people and ought to provide equal protection for everybody,â€ he said.

Paul was asked about Bruce Jenner coming out as a woman named Caitlyn. Social conservatives in the Republican Party have felt isolated by the nationâ€™s acceptance of Jenner, a change they see as immoral. Paul said he hasn't given Jenner's transition much thought but said that sexuality should remain private.

â€œWeâ€™ve exposed so much of our lives that were at one time private, and if it were private, than maybe the law wouldnâ€™t have to take a position on it, you know what I mean?â€ Paul said in an interview here.

Paul said that if he goes to a cocktail party, â€œmost of us donâ€™t talk about our personal sexuality, our sex lives, why does it have to be part of public discourse?â€
