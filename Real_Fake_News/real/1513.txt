The Islamic faith isnâ€™t â€œconsistentâ€ with the U.S. Constitution, and a Muslim shouldnâ€™t be president, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said.

â€œI would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation,â€ Carson said on NBCâ€™s 'Meet the Press' on Sunday.

 

 Late Sunday, he doubled down on those comments in an interview with The Hill.

 

 â€œI do not believe Sharia is consistent with the Constitution of this country,â€ Carson told The Hill. â€œMuslims feel that their religion is very much a part of your public life and what you do as a public official, and thatâ€™s inconsistent with our principles and our Constitution.â€

His view contrasted with that of Donald Trump, the billionaire front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, who said on the program that a Muslim as president is something that could happen in the future.

Trump said he knows many Muslims who are â€œfabulous,â€ but thereâ€™s â€œa very severe problemâ€ with some Muslims around the world -- comments he repeated on other Sunday broadcasts.
