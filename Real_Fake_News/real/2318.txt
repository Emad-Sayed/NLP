Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders said Sunday that American voters, superdelegates and others must â€œtake a hard lookâ€ at the recent federal report that found primary rival Hillary Clintonâ€™s email setup while running the State Department broke agency rules.

â€œIt was not a good report for Secretary Clinton. That is something that the American people, Democrats and delegates are going to have to take a hard look at," Sanders told CBS' "Face the Nation," during one of two TV network interviews Sunday.

The inspector generalâ€™s report last week concluded Clinton broke agency rules by using a private email server and that she would have been denied permission to have one had she first sought permission.

On Sunday, Sanders, desperately trailing the front-running Clinton in the delegate count, continued to not comment directly on the controversy.

But he repeated the notion that superdelegates, of which he needs more in a longshot bid to take the nomination, should indeed scrutinize the report.

â€œI mean everybody in America is keeping it in mind, and certainly the superdelegates are," Sanders said.

The Clinton campaign said Wednesday that the report shows "just how consistent (Clinton's) email practices were with those of other secretaries and senior officials at the State Department who also used personal email."

The campaign also said the report notes that Clinton's use of personal email was known to officials within the department and that there is no evidence to show any successful breach of the former secretary of state's server.

In a separate interview Sunday with NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Press,â€ Sanders said he is focused on â€œthe future of the American middle class and how we deal with the fundamental problems they are facing.â€

He also declined to comment on the FBI investigation into the Clinton email scandal, including what impact the findings might have on a Clinton general election bid.

However, Sanders appeared to perhaps take his concerns about the emails a step further, suggesting Americans are â€œtired of those kinds of politics.â€

And he made clear presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has and will continue to make an issue of them if and when he faces Clinton directly in the November election.

â€œDonald Trump and other Republicans will seize on it,â€ he told NBC. â€œThereâ€™s no doubting that.â€
