The nationâ€™s largest veterans group hit back at President Obama on Thursday and urged him not to â€œdenigrateâ€ their intelligence after the president suggested their members were easily swayed by cable news and â€œright-wing radio.â€

The Veterans of Foreign Wars called out the president after Obama referenced the political opinions at â€œVFW hallsâ€ in an Indiana speech Wednesday that toggled between campaign politics and the economy.

â€œI donâ€™t know how many VFW Posts the president has ever visited, but our near 1.7 million members are a direct reflection of America,â€ VFW National Commander John A. Biedrzycki Jr. said in a statement. â€œWe donâ€™t have confused politics, we donâ€™t need left or rightwing media filters telling us how to think or vote, and we donâ€™t need any President of the United States lecturing us about how we are individually [affected] by the economy.â€

Obama, speaking in Elkhart, Ind., had lamented the â€œprimary storyâ€ he claimed Republicans are telling about the economy â€“ one that focuses on how â€œmoochers at the bottom of the income ladderâ€ are squeezing middle-class families.

â€œWe have been hearing this story for decades,â€ Obama said. â€œTales about welfare queens, talking about takers, talking about the â€47percent.â€™ It's the story that is broadcast every day on some cable news stations, on right-wing radio, it's pumped into cars, and bars, and VFW halls all across America, and right here in Elkhart.â€

Obama continued: â€œAnd if you're hearing that story all the time, you start believing it. It's no wonder people think big government is the problem.â€

Biedrzycki suggested veterans are not so easily swayed.

â€œOur nation was created and continues to exist solely because of the men and women who wear the uniform,â€ he said. â€œLetâ€™s not denigrate their service, their sacrifice or their intelligence.â€

Obama is no stranger to the VFW, having addressed the groupâ€™s national convention several times dating back to his first presidential campaign.

He last spoke to the VFW convention last July in Pittsburgh, calling the occasion a â€œgreat honor.â€ He used the speech to address ongoing efforts to help Americaâ€™s veterans, especially in the area of health care, in the wake of the Veterans Affairs wait-times scandal.

â€œAs president, I consider it my obligation to help make sure that, even though less than 1 percent of Americans wear the uniform, that 100 percent of Americans honor your sacrifices and your service,â€ he said.
