The Republican National Committee triumphantly seized control of the debates last year, saying it would not allow a repeat of 2012, when â€œthe liberal media interrogated our candidates on issues that were often not a priority to most Americans. â€¦ We need more conservatives â€¦ in the moderatorâ€™s chair.â€

But what was a play to keep their candidates safe inside a conservative cocoon now looks like a trap. The first Republican presidential debate will air on Fox News and will be moderated by Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallaceâ€”who happen to be the same three anchors that have provoked three Republican candidates into embarrassing gaffes this month. Turns out Fox Newsâ€™ anchors can make Republican candidates look just as bad as MSNBCâ€™s.

The RNC sought to install more â€œconservatives in the moderatorâ€™s chairâ€ because conservatives still are nursing grudges against some of the 2012 primary debate moderators. When ABCâ€™s George Stephanopoulos pressed Mitt Romney on whether â€œstates have the right to ban contraception,â€ conservatives blamed the â€œliberal mediaâ€ for asking an irrelevant question. When CNNâ€™s John King opened a debate by asking Newt Gingrich about allegations leveled by his ex-wife, Gingrich brought the crowd to its feet by chastising King and lambasting â€œthe elite media protecting Barack Obama by attacking Republicans.â€

At least in those instances, Republicans could try the â€œblame the mediaâ€ strategy to limit the damage. This year, when Republicans shoot themselves in the foot on the debate stage, they wonâ€™t have that option.

The recent gaffes on Fox News by Republican candidates are not because Fox News journalists are suddenly out to get Republicans. Itâ€™s because even a softball question can trip up a candidate not ready for prime time. Megyn Kellyâ€™s interview of Jeb Bush was the journalistic equivalent of a warm hug. Her simple Iraq questionâ€”â€œKnowing what we know now, would you have authorized the invasion?â€â€”was only a couple of notches tougher than Katie Couricâ€™s â€œWhat newspapers and magazines did you regularly read?â€

After Jebâ€™s initial answer, which skipped past the hindsight premise, Kelly conversationally and neutrally asked for a clarification, â€œYou don't think it was a mistake?â€ When Jeb was done, she breezily moved on to a new line of questioning well-suited for Fox: â€œDo you feel that America's place in the world has diminished under President Obama?â€

But Fox News teased the Iraq clip before the full interview aired, sparking a media firestorm. Rivals Chris Christie and Ted Cruz, both fervent hawks, jumped in front of the microphone to proclaim they would not have invaded. Influential conservative radio talker Laura Ingraham was incredulous: â€œYou have to have [a nominee] who says, â€Look, Iâ€™m a Republican but Iâ€™m not an idiot â€¦ I learn from the past.â€™â€

Trying to clean up his mess a couple of days later, Bush ran to what should have been safe ground, Fox Newsâ€™ Sean Hannity. The host functioned less as a journalist than as a friend helping a friend in need. He first suggested â€œthe mediaâ€ interpreted Bush wrong and so â€œI wanted to see if I could clarify that.â€ After Bush failed to actually clarify, Hannity threw him a second lifeline, â€œSo in other words, with 20/20 hindsight, you would make a different decision.â€ Bush whiffed the softball, saying, â€œI donâ€™t know what that decision would have been.â€

Unlike the Kelly and Hannity chats, Chris Wallaceâ€™s recent interview with Marco Rubio was truly aggressive. He wouldnâ€™t let up over Rubioâ€™s abandonment of the Senate immigration bill for which he voted: â€œYou bailed on comprehensive immigration reform. â€¦ Aren't leaders supposed to shape public opinion rather than just follow it? â€¦ Shouldn't you have campaigned for this?â€ He also busted Rubio for a â€œdramatic shiftâ€ in his foreign policy rhetoric, backing off his 2012 support for Iran negotiations and forgoing earlier assurances he was â€œnot a saber-rattling person.â€

And those barbs were just the warm-up for the three-minute raking over Iraq. As Wallace bore into Rubioâ€™s varying responses, the unprepared Senate freshman dug himself into a hole by pleading semantic differences regarding questions about whether Iraq was a mistake and whether heâ€™d have invaded knowing what we know now. Relentless, Wallace asked Rubio about seven times â€œWas it a mistake?â€ And he refused to let Rubio answer it with caveats, cutting him off with â€œI'm not asking you that.â€

If Wallace were not working for Rupert Murdoch, the loaded questions, opinionated assertions and repeated interruptions would earn Wallace a lifetime membership in the Liberal Media Elite Club.

You can expect Wallace to be similarly unforgiving at the inaugural debate. In fact it was four Augusts ago when Wallace was the foil for Gingrichâ€™s first public haranguing of a debate moderator. (He did not care for what he called a â€œgotcha questionâ€: â€œHow do you respond to people who say that your campaign has been a mess so far?â€) Gingrich was not alone. Wallace dredged up Mitt Romneyâ€™s record of layoffs and Herman Cainâ€™s litany of amateurish remarks. Candidates who expect to get a free ride from Wallace will quickly become debate roadkill.
