Senator Elizabeth Warren has declared herself ready to be Hillary Clintonâ€™s running mate in the US presidential election.

The Massachusetts senator â€“ popular among the progressive wing of the Democratic party â€“ made the declaration shortly after endorsing Clinton, calling her â€œa fighter with gutsâ€ who would keep Donald Trump out the White House.

In an interview on MSNBC, Warren was asked by Rachel Maddow: â€œIf you were asked to be Secretary Clintonâ€™s running mate, do you believe you could do it?â€



In another interview with the Boston Globe on Thursday, Warren endorsed Clinton as the partyâ€™s presidential nominee, saying: â€œIâ€™m ready to jump in this fight and make sure that Hillary Clinton is the next president of the United States and be sure that Donald Trump gets nowhere near the White House.â€

According to the Globe she also praised Clintonâ€™s primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, saying that he had run an â€œincredible campaignâ€.



Speaking to MSNBCâ€™s Rachel Maddow on Thursday evening, Warren said the Sanders campaign had been â€œpowerfully importantâ€.

â€œHe ran a campaign from the heart, and he ran a campaign where he took these issues and really thrust them into the spotlight â€“ issues that are near and dear to my heart â€“ and he brought millions of people into the democratic process,â€ she said.



But, Warren said, â€œHillary Clinton won. And she won because sheâ€™s a fighter, sheâ€™s out there, sheâ€™s tough. And I think this is what we need.â€

Warrenâ€™s endorsement came within hours of President Barack Obama formally giving his endorsement to Clintonâ€™s candidacy. â€œIâ€™m with her,â€ Obama said, in a video recorded on Tuesday. â€œI donâ€™t think there has ever been someone so qualified to hold this office.â€

Vice-President Joe Biden also appeared to give his endorsement on Thursday, referring in a speech to â€œâ€¦ whoever the next president is â€“ and God willing it will be Hillary Clintonâ€.



Warren, a favourite of the progressive left who taught constitutional law at Harvard, is seen as a possible running mate who could help entice back a disaffected left that has been excited by Sanders but ambivalent about Clinton.



Warren has been especially fierce recently in her criticism of Donald Trump, attacking the presumptive Republican nominee in a searing string of speeches, setting herself up for a prominent and pugilistic role in the presidential election whether she is on the ticket or not.



Earlier on Thursday, at a speech to the American Constitution Society in Washington DC, Warren hit out at Trump as â€œjust a businessman who inherited a fortune and kept it rolling along by cheating peopleâ€.

She described him as â€œa loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud who â€¦ serves no one but himselfâ€, and said his attacks on Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge presiding over the Trump University suit, was â€œexactly what you would expect from somebody who is a thin-skinned racist bullyâ€.
