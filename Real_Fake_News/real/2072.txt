It is a little after midnight on a Friday in late January. I am in a strip club in Morgantown, West Virginia, drinking shit American beer that tastes like ice and newspaper. A man is passing me a semi-automatic handgun and telling me to pull the trigger. The man is John Barron; the gun is a Browning Hi-Power. It once belonged to an Israeli police officer, but now it belongs to Jeff, Johnâ€™s brother, an early birthday present to himself. Together they own this strip club, the Blue Parrot Cabaret, dark and sparse with a front door the color of cherry skin. Across the street is a place that sells all-terrain vehicles; two miles up the road, a half-dozen fraternity houses sit on top of a steep hill that your car will groan to climb. John releases the magazine and holds the slide back to show me thereâ€™s nothing in the chamber. He is the type of man who could have worked at a video store or sold comic books or telescopes, a man proud to be a connoisseur. And now here he is, in a building that Jeff needed to mortgage his farm six years ago to help him open, on the fringes of a college town, the both of them sitting at a back table in a palace of human fantasies, talking about guns while half-naked women lead men upstairs by the hand to squishy leather love seats. John passes the Browning to me. Itâ€™s heavy and solid, something that should be obvious but is still startling somehow, immediately. â€œFeel the trigger on that,â€ Jeff says. I do. It feels smooth and light, like pushing an elevator button, except this is a thing designed for death. Printed on Jeffâ€™s black T-shirt, in skinny white letters: â€œby reading this shirt you have given me brief control over your mind.â€ John and Jeff take out another gun, the recently released Ruger American 9-mm pistol, black and plastic-y, and then another, a tiny .380 Kel-Tec. Jeffâ€™s eyes flash down to the guns and then back up to me and then back down again, all of them laid out on the counter. â€œWelcome to West Virginia,â€ he says. I am in West Virginia to understand Donald Trump. At least, to the extent that the political embodiment of a Hardeeâ€™s commercial needs to be understood. Specifically, Iâ€™m here to understand the people who want him to be president. Last December, The New York Times published a reportâ€”based on statistics from Civis Analytics, a Democratic data firmâ€”that found West Virginia to have the highest support for Trump in the country. In its first congressional districtâ€”the northern part of the state, where Morgantown is locatedâ€”45 percent of those polled said they would choose Trump over any other G.O.P. candidate. On some level, this isnâ€™t a surprise. West Virginia hasnâ€™t voted for a Democrat in a presidential election since 1996. The state, according to Census data, is 93 percent white and 88 percent native-born. And environmental restrictions targeting the coal industryâ€”the central nervous system of the West Virginia economyâ€”have been taken by many as a personal assault, a condemnation of the stateâ€™s culture, its history, its blue-collar virtues. The mess of these things has brought Obamaâ€™s approval rating in West Virginia as low as almost anywhere else in the country. And so I have come here to meet people like John and Jeff, people who see Trump as the renegade out for justice, as someone who is not impulsive but decisive; not cruel but honest; not bombastic but patriotic; not indecent but uninhibited. You may wonder, How could someone vote for a man so resistant to grace, to convention, to good taste? And those people will tell you, look where good taste brought us.

One afternoon at the Bluebird store in Clarksburgâ€”part diner, grocery store, and social clubâ€”I meet Shane Shreves, a fourth-generation union coal miner. He wants Trump to be president. In 2015, he says, he lost 262 miners to layoffs at his mine alone, Robinson Run No. 95. â€œCoal has carried West Virginia on its back for 200 years,â€ he tells me. â€œItâ€™s built schools. Communities. Itâ€™s not anger [we feel here], really, itâ€™s just very frustrating.â€ Eric Leaseburg, the owner of the store, sits down at a big round table with us. He has a full plate of food in front of him. Shreves finishes a thought, and then Leaseburg says, as he loads up his fork, â€œI donâ€™t even know if [West Virginians] want to see Trump president, but theyâ€™re just that pissed off.â€ And, well, if youâ€™re pissed off, if your hopes for your stagnant town have wilted and died, who better than Donald Trump, Americaâ€™s tooth fairy emeritus? He is a man who has turned the excruciating, real-life, how-are-we-keeping-the-lights-on pissed off into something marketable, a 140-characters version of pissed off, something easily packaged and disseminated. Trump is politician as pickup artist, as infomercial salesman; someone who will in a single breath pulverize your self-esteem and then convince you that he is the only one who can put you back together again, speaking in empty hyperbole, all â€œloveâ€ and â€œdisastersâ€; someone to resuscitate all of your sputtering little egos with something grand and implausible. He loves everyone, everything, heâ€™s going to take you home tonight, you have such beautiful eyes, baby, what are you doing here all alone? I can make you great again. Donald Trump is an American. But before that he is a mogul, a helicopter passenger, a monolith of barely considered interjections. His Twitter feed is a scroll of grave warnings and half-present admonishments of America-down-the-shitter. Is it any wonder that the same day Trump received an endorsement from Sarah Palin, he also received one from the daughter of John Wayne, another counterfeit cowboy? Trump behaves like a man bored enough by fame and wealth that he can manufacture an adversarial relationship with a nation just to challenge it. Someone so aroused by the idea of being outrageous and condescending that it seems to almost border on erotic for him. Someone who has spent his life negotiating, convincing, selling you things you donâ€™t need for a price you canâ€™t afford. He is selling not a commodity now but an inspirational hokum, a life raft, a rope ladder from a helicopter.

I am getting coffee for my ride north, stopping in Charleston, West Virginia, in Ginoâ€™s Pizza & Spaghetti House. There are posters on the wall for â€œOur Famous Pubwichâ€ and â€œGinos Original Sicilian Baked Subâ€ and â€œOld World Pepperoni Cheesy Bread.â€ The pictures of the items on the posters look â€œfamousâ€ the way mug shots look famous. The store manager, Cheryl Hall, has short blonde hair and punctuates every sentence with sweetie-sugar-honey-baby, putting her elbows on the counter to listen to you talk. She moved from Ohio to West Virginia in 1982, and in April sheâ€™ll have been working at Ginoâ€™s for 11 years. â€œI started and I didnâ€™t think much of it,â€ she says. â€œI didnâ€™t know it was gonna be a career. I wish I was like my son sometimes, he makes me realize maybe Iâ€™m not so ambitious.â€ Her son is 22. â€œHeâ€™s the light and the gift,â€ she says. I ask her about the election. â€œMe and my husband, we almost donâ€™t wanna say it out loud, but we kinda like Trump, his ideas. He just doesnâ€™t have, whatâ€™s the word for it? Couth?â€ I make my way to Clarksburg, the two-hour drive on I-79, empty and wide, the sunset pure and purple and orange against the snow-covered hills, barren for miles and miles except for the little dots of civilization, smoke coming from a house you canâ€™t see at first, tire tracks in the dirt. In West Virginia, no matter where you are, you never feel far from nowhere. I spend part of my night at the Brickside Bar & Grill, just outside Clarksburg, the fifth-largest city in the first district. Population, according to the 2010 census: 16,578. State motto: Jewel of the Hills. Dennyâ€™s locations: one. At Brickside, I meet a man named Steve. Steve asks Tammy, the bartender, for some menu guidance. â€œYou canâ€™t go wrong with the steak hoagie,â€ she says. â€œWe have a sriracha-agave wing sauce, itâ€™s sriracha, agave, and spices they wonâ€™t tell me about,â€ Tammy says. Steve makes a face that says, â€œsecret recipes are bullshit.â€ Then he asks her if they still make the fried-bologna sandwich. They do. He orders that, and an order of the wings. He tells Tammy, â€œMake sure they donâ€™t cook the hell out of the wings. You know these pre-cooked wings, you donâ€™t need to cook them for 10 minutes like they say.â€ Steve is a managing partner at the Outback Steakhouse near Clarksburg, so as a purveyor of mass-consumed deep-fried products, he is something of an expert. â€œIâ€™ve worked in restaurants all my life,â€ he says. The conversation turns to the imperiled local economy. Steve, by way of explanation, quotes a scene from Dumb and Dumber in which Jim Carreyâ€™s and Jeff Danielsâ€™s characters come back to their apartment after a day hunting for employment. He recites Danielsâ€™s line: â€œI canâ€™t believe thereâ€™s no jobs in this town.â€ Then Carreyâ€™s: â€œYeah, unless you wanna work 40 hours a week.â€ His sentences tend to start peacefully, calculated, then the words gather like storm clouds, heading toward a profanity, pieces of crust from his fried bologna sandwich falling onto his black Pittsburgh Steelers sweatshirt. â€œWhat this country is right now is a hornetâ€™s nest.â€ He has some more sandwich; we drink beer. â€œIâ€™m all about conservation, you know. I love to fish, I love the beauty of nature. But China, Japan, you think they give a shit about the environment? But weâ€™re supposed to?â€ He continues, â€œItâ€™s the hypocrisy of it all. You know, like Hollywood. You remember Clint Eastwood, he gets up there [at the Republican National Convention in 2012] and he gets shredded. And heâ€™s never been late on a movie set, heâ€™s never been over budget. But he gets shredded. But then you have some of these actors up there, these motherfuckers all think theyâ€™re statesmen, and some of them didnâ€™t even finish high school.â€ Before he leaves, he gives me a list of places to visit around town; itâ€™s one of the few moments in our conversation he speaks with an unrestrained love for something. This will keep happening to me, people talking about the decency of other West Virginians and ordinary-seeming food as if it were a dream they had. Outside at the Brickside, there is an enclosed patio with heat lamps and stationary towers that have flames spitting out of them. A guy with dark bushy hair dances sloppily to â€œLove Shackâ€ by the B-52s as someone else sings it in karaoke. The waitress says to Tammy, â€œThat kid outside is kinda cute.â€ â€œYeah?â€ Tammy says. The waitress adds, â€œI think thatâ€™s because heâ€™s sort of hipster-ish, I donâ€™t know.â€ This, apparently, is progressivism in West Virginia: semi-unkempt hair and an earring. The D.J. shouts, â€œWe got some Nicki Minaj coming at you!,â€ and the crowd cheers like it hasnâ€™t all night, like itâ€™s preparing to bungee jump over the waters of rap music and dangle there for a few moments. Then a bunch of West Virginians with identical buzz cuts dance like they have nausea. Someone does the raise-the-roof motion. A pretty, tall blonde woman in a snug leather jacket indulges a dozen half-advances from guys in hats bearing logos for golf brands or sporting-goods chains. I go back to the hotel; my room looks out over a gas station and a place called Eatâ€™n Park. Its sign reads: â€œCALORIES DONâ€™T COUNT IF THEY SMILE.â€

The next day, as Iâ€™m walking around downtown Clarksburg, I see a tall man in his 70s, Jim Hileman, standing in the entrance of the Lordâ€™s Pantry food bank. Hileman is a Trump supporter: â€œI support the man because heâ€™s crazy like me.â€ Then he laughs in a tone somewhere between mall Santa Claus and Batman villain hatching a diabolical plan. Heâ€™s been helping at the food pantry for about 10 years. He started out volunteering after he left his job at a funeral home, then he just kept doing it. He tells me to get to Ritz Lunch at some point to try their hot dogs. You have never heard people speak so fondly, so intimately about hot dogs. Not, like, the nuances of them, but their very existence, the way you would talk about a grandmother or an old Labrador. Itâ€™s part reverence, part nostalgia. I have never cared as much about anything as this man did about a hot-dog recommendation. It was sincere and beautiful, him imparting this to someone, a kind of treasure map. Two men are talking at a table when I walk into the Bluebird store. â€œTobacco by itself probably doesnâ€™t even cause all those cancersâ€”itâ€™s the chemicals,â€ a man says. He finishes eating and leans back in his chair. â€œThatâ€™s a pretty good lunch right there now. Thatâ€™s like a dinner.â€ It isnâ€™t a bad lunch, it must be said. I ask a woman named Pam if I can sit down and eat next to her and her friend. I tell her the purpose of this story and she almost deflates in her chair. Donald Trump alters her posture, literally. â€œWe always get dumped on,â€ she says. â€œThereâ€™s this idea of [West Virginians] as bumpkins or whatever, but Kentucky has rural areas, too, you know? No one thinks of them like this. I hate to see us in a poll like that leading for Trump because it almost makes us look dumber. . . . At first I thought: Wow, heâ€™ll go where no one else goes. We need that. But the more I hear him the more I think heâ€™s just dangerous.â€ Across town, there are people trudging through the snow, pushing strollers around puddles, catching their breath outside the Dairy Queen. I walk into the Humane Society thrift store. There are bottles of half-used lotion, open boxes of Band-Aids for sale, a playpen full of stuffed animals, a bookshelf with a bundle of plastic bags tacked to it and a sign that reads, in black marker, â€œBOOKS 50¢ BAG.â€ Next to the cash register: a Donald J. Trumpâ€“brand shirt that looks like everything he has ever worn. White cuffs and white collar, a shade of blue that is just a little brighter and bluer than it needs to be. A volunteer named Joyce Insani looks at it and says, â€œIs anyone even gonna buy this shirt?â€ Another volunteer named Becky Steptoe walks by. â€œCareful what you say about our next president,â€ she says. I ask Becky if she likes that idea. â€œWell the country is a business. I think we need a businessman to run it.â€ Joyce is wearing a fleece vest the color of pink jelly beans. I ask her what she thinks. â€œI donâ€™t really know what to think about him. Heâ€™s very successful, so heâ€™s got to be smart.â€ Sheâ€™s sorting womenâ€™s tops while she tells me this. â€œBut I donâ€™t think weâ€™ll be able to fix this till we restore our faith in God.â€

There are pockets all over West Virginia where business is something simple and utilitarian, practical, hand-painted signs hanging from stores that say â€œJunk Junk,â€ and beneath it, pots and pans and brooms and plastic lawn chairs. The next day, I head to the Northeast, through towns of a few hundred people, towns that are 97 percent white (Grafton) and 99 percent (Rowlesburg). I pass cemeteries and trucks that look abandoned, rusty machinery in backyards. Everywhere there are things leaning, teetering; you might consider this metaphorically, but it is literally true, the houses are breaking. I pass small shops and enterprises, one after another, places called Morganâ€™s Muffler Inspection and Daveâ€™s Autobody; Larewâ€™s Used Car, Jackâ€™s Car Wash, Debbieâ€™s Pantry, a human with a name who had an idea for a place to do a thing and then did it. I pull into a roadside restaurant in Grafton called Biggieâ€™s. In the magazine rack, behind two candy machines that sell Skittles for a quarter, is a December 7 issue of the tabloid the Globe. On the cover in all capital letters: â€œIMPEACH OBAMA,â€ and a crosshair over the Statue of Liberty. There is one other customer inside Biggieâ€™s; heâ€™s a corrections officer at the Pruntytown Correctional Center. He has pale blue eyes and dime-size pupils that make everything he says seem wild and intense and on the verge of recklessness. â€œI like the idea of Donald Trump. Heâ€™s going to run it like a business. He donâ€™t care who he offends. Heâ€™s gonna pull no punches. One of the things America was formed on was saying what you feel. We built this country on offending people.â€ He wonâ€™t give me his name, and I donâ€™t make any progress asking a second and third time. â€œYou donâ€™t need my name.â€ Farther east, the town of Rowlesburg used to house the largest sawmill factory in the country. Now it has a population of 584. Three bars are boarded up, the church is closed, and the VFWâ€™s walk isnâ€™t shoveled. At the Sidetracked Bar and Grill, the bar is empty for the hour Iâ€™m there. Two trains pass. Mary Goff is standing behind the counter in front of two tap handles: Bud Light and Budweiser. I ask for a Budweiser, but they donâ€™t have any beer yet; theyâ€™ve been waiting months for their license. I ask Goff what she thinks about Trump. â€œHeâ€™s maybe not the greatest person in the world,â€ she explains, â€œbut heâ€™s a businessman.â€ When West Virginians talk about the man, there is a mystique, an almost shamanistic wisdom granted to â€œbusinessâ€ people, anything associated with tycoons or their largesse, the implied clout and sophistication of a New Yorker in a shiny pink tie. â€œIâ€™ll be honest with you,â€ one college kid named Eric tells me later that night, at a bar in Morgantown. â€œTrump has a ball sack, but I donâ€™t know if he knows what the fuck heâ€™s doing.â€ His friend, Erik, leans in, â€œBut can you imagine him approaching, like, Saudi Arabia or something with that kind of mentality?â€ Eric interjects before reason can get in the way. â€œHeâ€™ll be fine,â€ he says, nodding confidently. And that, really, is its own sort of currency. Trumpâ€™s red-lining testosterone, his brazen dismissals of rivals, the way he duels with other candidates in ways that have nothing to do with policy, but everything to do with something essential about being a human, getting embarrassed and ignored in public. When Trump says, â€œRubio, Iâ€™ve never seen a young guy sweat that much,â€ heâ€™s winning in a way that seems irrelevant but also sort of irrefutable.

The Blue Parrot almost never opened in the first place. Jeff and John began renovations in March of 2010, but by mid-April the town was trying to stop them. Eventually, the county passed an ordinance that prohibited adult-entertainment venues from operating within 2,000 feet of churches, schools, or residential areas, but only after the Blue Parrot Cabaret was grandfathered in. And the county still fought them. Six years later, the clubâ€™s still here. â€œWe had a terrible, terrible time,â€ John says. â€œThere was no winning or losing. There was only winning. Once everything you own is on the line, itâ€™s no longer options. Itâ€™s no longer choices. Itâ€™s going to work.â€ Iâ€™m talking to John about how the stateâ€™s population has hovered at around 2 million for the last 70 years, rounding myself into the same sort of defeatism Iâ€™ve heard in the people Iâ€™ve met here. He describes for me how the literal topography, the shape of the earth, restricts what sort of industries can survive. I ask him how itâ€™s possible to not walk around mad all the time. Then Jeff says, from a few steps away, â€œWell you do. I think thatâ€™s why Trump appeals.â€ What do you do about any of this? â€œA lot of what gets done in West Virginia is through brute force,â€ he says. I imagine all these people left on their own, stranded, forgotten. I think about what Albert Camus said in The Stranger, â€œIt was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.â€ I find no bumpkins in West Virginia. Nor do I find any Trump shrines. The only political paraphernalia I see, over three and a half days, is for Bernie Sanders. Instead of the burbling hints of a revolution, I find a pervading sense of resignation. People drift occasionally into states of indignation or anger, but mostly they express ambivalence. These are people who are familiar with dense winter skies, interstates that stretch and bend over the horizon, things that feel all around like theyâ€™re breaking or on an incline or carved through rock or forest or around rivers. Whether Trump exists to you as Vine superstar, or a political pioneer, or the hellion king in the cockpit of a kamikaze mission, something seems inescapable: this is West Virginia, this is its plight, things giant and immovable. And so I imagine you can get mad at the Democrats, at the idea of political correctness, at the grinding wheels of bureaucracy, at the notion of people trying to take your guns or your strip club or your job digging coal from the earth. At the passing train that momentarily brings your dying little town to a halt. At the person who keeps asking you for your name. You can be furious at things so big and maddeningly abstract that a tyrannosaur parade float of a man seems like a savior. But sometimes, all you can do is get mad at the mountains. Donald Trump has zeroed in on Americaâ€™s percolating xenophobic aggression, harnessed the impulses behind it and tried to amplify them, using simple-as-that declarations that he will ban Muslims and Syrians and build walls, file lawsuits, circling the wagons and rebuilding, transforming. Delicate takes time, restraint takes time. Sledgehammers get right to it. There are people either tantalized by the mirage, tantalized by a man who would so shamelessly peddle the mirage, or leveled enough by rhetoric and empty idealism that they donâ€™t have time for any of it. Sometimes the mirage looks pretty, sometimes the mirage looks real, sometimes itâ€™s a con and we know it. On the last day of my trip, a man with a beard creeping high up his cheeks and a 30-case of Busch Light in one hand is on his way out of a convenience store. We talk about presidents. Heâ€™s holding the door open now with his foot wedged at the bottom, the cuffs of his pants torn and caked with mud, as people come in and out of the store. I ask him if he likes Trump, if he likes anyone, if he cares. Itâ€™s starting to snow. He turns and spits a long stream of black tobacco juice through the air, and then he looks back at me. â€œWhoever it is,â€ he says, â€œif they ainâ€™t a thief now, they will be by the time they in office.â€ Then heâ€™s gone. â€œO.K., you, in the third rowâ€¦ Yes, youâ€¦ Iâ€™m calling on youâ€¦ Yes, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m pointingâ€¦ Iâ€™m pointing with my fingerâ€¦ My FINGER. This oneâ€¦ Why would you think Iâ€™m holding up a cocktail frank?â€ In Iowa last January, Trump regales voters with a humanizing personal anecdote about how he once bit his right index finger after mistaking it for a half-eaten French fry. A wax figure of â€œDukeâ€ Wayne looks on in disgust as Trump strains to reach his fingers all the way around daughter Aissa Wayneâ€™s frankly rather petite shoulder. (Fun fact: you could load the barrel of Wayneâ€™s pistol with 14 of Trumpâ€™s pinkies.) As Trump talks straight through a lunch-hour town hall in February, hungry New Hampshire voters appear mesmerized by the five chicken-tender-like appendages radiating from his sausage-patty-size palm. Greeting voters in Iowa City, Trump surreptitiously compares his hand to a babyâ€™s, a smile of satisfaction and relief slowly spreading across his face. At the 1990 grand opening of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, wee hands try to summon a genie from a giant lamp. â€œItâ€™s the motion,â€ Trump gamely jokes. At a recent G.O.P. debate in Las Vegas, Trumpâ€™s â€œfun-sizeâ€ grip fails to circumnavigate Chris Christieâ€™s big, beefy palm. Trump attempts to regain alpha-male status by showing the New Jersey governor his impression of a Doberman pinscher wagging its docked tail. An interesting optical illusion: Trumpâ€™s left hand is actually in the foreground of the picture! More ugly politics in South Carolina: Trump is forced to refute rumors, traced back to the Cruz campaign, that his fingers arenâ€™t long enough for Christian prayer. Trump pretends to enjoy a pork chop on a stick at the 2015 Iowa State Fair, probably the one place on Earth where people wonâ€™t mistake a pork chop on a stick for Trumpâ€™s third hand. In costume with actress Megan Mullally at the 2005 Emmys, Trump wows an audience of hardened entertainment professionals by wrapping his fingers nearly all the way around a pitchfork. Some pundits have attributed candidate Trumpâ€™s hawkishness to the fact that, even though his fingers have as many joints as a normal manâ€™s, they remain at least an inch short of being able to form a proper peace sign. Nothing much to say about the fingers in this picture; just curious why Trumpâ€™s â€œanus mouthâ€ face hasnâ€™t also become a thing. To this day, clubhouse attendants maintain that Trump had to be outfitted with a Babe Ruth Jr. Youth League glove for this 1991 appearance at Yankee Stadium. At this 2005 gala, Trump, thinking quickly, uses both hands to keep wife Melania from getting a good look at the size of a single Puff Daddy hand. Trumpâ€™s delicate right hand is nearly crushed by his nine-year-old daughter Ivankaâ€™s huge, burly mitt at a 1991 event.
