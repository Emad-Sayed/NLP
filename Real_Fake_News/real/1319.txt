WASHINGTON â€” President Obama sought to spotlight the effects of global warming Saturday as he prepared to travel to Alaska this coming week.

â€œAlaskans are already living with its effects,â€ he said in his weekly address.

The state â€” currently experiencing one of its worst wildfire seasons on record â€” is expected to see its average temperatures rise by 6 to 12 degrees if nothing is done to halt climate change, Obama said. Four villages there are already in imminent danger from rising sea waters as sea ice and glaciers melt.

â€œThis is all real. This is happening to our fellow Americans right now,â€ he said. â€œThink about that. If another country threatened to wipe out an American town, weâ€™d do everything in our power to protect ourselves. Climate change poses the same threat, right now.â€

The president is striking a tricky balance between environmental conservation and energy production â€” he has long supported expanded oil drilling off the Alaskan coast, the very fuel that has contributed to global warming.

Obama is facing sharp criticism from environmentalists for his Alaska trip, which begins Monday. One activist organization, CREDO, said the presidentâ€™s visit is a symbol of â€œthe self-defeating hypocrisy of his policies on energy and climate.â€

â€œClimate leaders donâ€™t drill the Arctic,â€ the group said in an online petition. â€œTalking about the urgency of climate change while allowing massive fossil fuel extraction isnâ€™t leadership, itâ€™s hypocrisy.â€

Obama said in his weekly address that he shares concerns about offshore oil drilling, noting he remembers the BP oil spill in the Gulf â€œall too well.â€ But he said the United States still has to rely on oil and gas while it is transitioning toward renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar.

â€œAs long as thatâ€™s the case, I believe we should rely more on domestic production than on foreign imports, and we should demand the highest safety standards in the industry â€” our own,â€ Obama said.

He noted that while his administration issued a permit to Shell to drill off the Alaskan coast, it also mandated strict safety standards that the company has yet to meet.

â€œItâ€™s a testament to how rigorous weâ€™ve applied those standards that Shell has delayed and limited its exploration off Alaska while trying to meet them,â€ Obama said. â€œThe bottom line is, safety has been and will continue to be my administrationâ€™s top priority when it comes to oil and gas exploration off Americaâ€™s precious coasts.â€

During his three-day trip, Obama is scheduled to participate in a climate change conference in Anchorage, tour a glacier and travel to coastal fishing towns.

â€œIâ€™m looking forward to talking with Alaskans about how we can work together to make America the global leader on climate change around the globe,â€ he said. â€œBecause whatâ€™s happening in Alaska is happening to us. Itâ€™s our wakeup call, and as long as Iâ€™m president, America will lead the world to meet the threat of climate change before itâ€™s too late.â€
