The political comedian, who is promoting the upcoming season of â€œReal Time with Bill Maher,â€ was responding to the attack on Charlie Hebdo, which left 12 people dead, 11 wounded and is viewed as a direct attack on freedom of speech.

â€œThis has to stop, and unfortunately, a lot of the liberals, who are my tribe â€” I am a proud liberalâ€“â€ Maher began.

â€œHeâ€™s about to turn on you,â€ Kimmel joked.

â€œNo, Iâ€™m not turning on them,â€ Maher continued. â€œIâ€™m asking them to turn toward the truth, as I have been for quite a while. Iâ€™m the liberal in this debate. Iâ€™m for free speech. To be a liberal, you have to stand up for liberal principles. Itâ€™s not my fault that the part of the world that is most against liberal principles is the Muslim part of the world.â€

Maher contended that most Muslims would not carry out such an attack, but claimed that â€œhundreds of millions of themâ€ support attacks of this manner. Maher called for a complete condemnation of the attack, and broadened his view to the dangers of all religion. â€œWe have to stop saying when something like this that happened in Paris today, we have to stop saying, well, we should not insult a great religion,â€ Maher said. â€œFirst of all, there are no great religions; theyâ€™re all stupid and dangerous. And we should insult them, and we should be able to insult whatever we want. That is what free speech is like.â€
