Hillary Clinton and the Democrats say America is stronger together. But they're not yet living up to the unifying spirit of their slogan.

Because I needed props for a theatrical performance, I bought campaign paraphernalia from several of the final candidates. So, snuggled together on the shelf behind my desk, I have a Trump hat, a Hillary T-shirt, a Bernie coffee mug, and a couple of Cruz buttons.

As you can imagine, people are often confused by the collection. They have never seen all four of those items in the same place at the same time. But isnâ€™t that actually an accurate portrait of what Hillary Clintonâ€™s slogan, â€œstronger together,â€ means?

Because of my work, which is building bridges across the partisan divide, I sent my recent book to the Clinton and Trump campaigns. I received responses from both. From the vice-chair of her campaign, Huma Abedin, I received a very courteous note thanking me for supporting her candidate and wishing me much success with the book. And from â€œTeam Trumpâ€ I received a thank you letter and two bumper stickers that say (guess what?): â€œMake America Great Again!â€

But let me set the record straight. When â€œTeam Trumpâ€ told me they were â€œhonored to call me a valuable member of our team and to work with us on rescuing the future of our country,â€ I realized that they had not taken my letter seriously. I was not volunteering to join their campaign. I was asking them to change the way they were campaigning. I asked them to read my book because I wanted their standard-bearer to unite America, not divide it. Obviously, they are not listening.

And although I strongly prefer Secretary Clinton to Mr. Trump for president, I was not volunteering to work on her campaign, either. I sent my book because I wanted the Clinton campaign to change its tone as well.

I watched Clinton speak recently to a crowd of 3,000 ardent fans in a packed high school gymnasium in Colorado.  Carefully positioned behind Hillary so that the cameras would see her, a lone dissenter held up a cloth banner that read â€œStop DNC Corruptionâ€ and shouted out the same message denouncing the Democratic National Committee. But Clinton supporters around her held up their blue placards with the words â€œStronger Togetherâ€ so that she and her protest sign soon became invisible.

It is just one detail on the campaign trail, of course. But it was a telling moment because it reminds us that â€œstronger togetherâ€ is not just a slogan for getting elected. Just as the words â€œMake America Great Againâ€ cannot be reduced to blindly endorsing an egomaniac, â€œStronger Togetherâ€ cannot be reduced to rallying around one remarkable woman. Unless it means something more than that, it feels more like George Orwellâ€™s â€œnewspeakâ€ than an uplifting call for unity.

The protester being silenced and surrounded was a Bernie Sanders supporter. She was an older, solitary woman who still harbored a grudge about how her hero from Vermont had been treated by DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and her staff. If the next president of the United States cannot include her in the â€œstronger togetherâ€ tent, then what exactly does â€œtogetherâ€ mean?

While the Sanders dissenter was being escorted from the gym, Clinton was repeating one of her favorite lines from her convention speech.  â€œI want to be the president for all Americans,â€ she shouted over the raucous applause. â€œDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents!â€

Despite that admirable rhetoric, neither campaign currently embodies the deepest meaning of â€œstronger together.â€ Before Clinton spoke, for example, no independents or Republicans were invited to speak. To make matters worse, when US Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D) of Colorado opened the event, he welcomed the audience by shouting out a welcome to all the â€œColorado Democratsâ€ present in the room.

Like 4 in 10 Americans, I am an Independent. I know for a fact that there were many of us, as well as Republicans, in the gym. Yet the congressmanâ€™s welcome was only to members of his party. His words contradicted what Clinton was claiming she wanted to be â€“ a president for â€œall Americans.â€ And it undermined the slogan being waved madly in the air by the crowd.

So if â€œstronger togetherâ€ is going to be the mantra for the Clinton campaign, letâ€™s take it seriously.

â€¢ We need to learn from those who disagree with us, not demonize them.

â€¢ We commit ourselves to developing a healthy relationship with our adversaries, not treating them like â€œenemies.â€

â€¢ We focus on meeting the challenges facing our country (problem-solving) rather than being â€œrightâ€ (position-taking).

â€¢ We remember that after campaigning comes governing, and whoever wins needs to be able to lead our country effectively in a troubled world.

In other words, letâ€™s not just carry the banner. Letâ€™s behave that way toward others. If we actually want to be â€œstronger together,â€ letâ€™s not just shout it; letâ€™s be it.
