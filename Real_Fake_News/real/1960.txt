In keeping with the generally staid disposition of the Gray Lady, one might have expected the New York Times editorial board to chide the Republican senators seeking to torpedo the Iran nuclear talks as â€œmisguided,â€ â€œwrongheaded,â€ â€œimprudent,â€ or some such. But instead, the Times on Thursday published  a scathing editorial condemning the GOPâ€™s diplomatic sabotage in unusually blistering language: The GOPâ€™s stunts, the headline announces, reflect nothing less than â€œRepublican Idiocy on Iran.â€

Denouncing Sen. Tom Cottonâ€™s (R-AR) â€œdisgraceful and irresponsibleâ€ letter to the Iranian leadership â€” signed by 46 other GOP senators â€” the Timesâ€™ editors contend that by warning Iranâ€™s leaders that a future president could nix a nuclear deal, Republicans engaged in â€œa blatant, dangerous effort to undercut the president on a grave national security issue by communicating directly with a foreign government.â€

â€œBesides being willing to sabotage any deal with Iran (before they know the final details), these Republicans are perfectly willing to diminish Americaâ€™s standing as a global power capable of crafting international commitments and adhering to them,â€ the editors write, echoing the criticism put forth by Vice President Joe Biden, who issued a statement this week arguing that the letter conveys â€œa highly misleading signal to friend and foe alike that that our Commander-in-Chief cannot deliver on Americaâ€™s commitments â€” a message that is as false as it is dangerous.â€

Although many Cotton detractors seized on the Iranian foreign ministerâ€™s swift dismissal of the communiqu©, the Times notes that it could nevertheless â€œembolden hard-liners in Iranâ€ who seek confrontation, not conciliation.

â€œIn rejecting diplomacy, the Republicans make an Iranian bomb and military conflict more likely,â€ the Times concludes.

For many, that may be precisely the point.
