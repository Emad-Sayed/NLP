Ohio governor John Kasich, who is still running for president, effectively reminded the public of his continued presence in the Republican presidential race on Friday by making a rather regressive comment about how women could avoid being sexually assaulted.

â€œDonâ€™t go to parties where thereâ€™s a lot of alcohol,â€ Kasich suggested during an appearance at St. Lawrence University, in Canton, New York, when a female student asked how he would tackle sexual violence at colleges and universities. Kasich, a millennial in an older manâ€™s body, provided several policy answersâ€”increase access to rape kits and confidential reporting, for instanceâ€”and then provided that â€œone bit of advice.â€

Recognizing within minutes that he might have stepped in it, the Kasich Twitter feed went hastily into damage control mode:

This isnâ€™t the first time that Kasich has made awkward comments about women this week. On Tuesday, he was baffled during a town hall when a young woman asked him about social security, responding, â€œDid someone tell you to ask that question?â€ (Her response: â€œNo, I think for myself.â€)

Not surprisingly, Kasich has a history of making regularly cringeworthy comments about women. His greatest hits include telling a female questioner at a town hall â€œI donâ€™t have any tickets for Taylor Swift,â€ and bragging about how women â€œleft their kitchensâ€ to vote for him in Ohio. In February, he signed a bill defunding Planned Parenthood, and in 2013, he signed a gag rule into law that cut funding for rape crisis centers that provided information about abortion services.

Women may not all love John Kasich, but John Kasich loves them. â€œAre you available?â€ he asked one woman who stood up to ask a question at a campaign event earlier this month. â€œYou look great tonight.â€ Right on schedule, governor.
