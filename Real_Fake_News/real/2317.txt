Republican presidential candidates are attacking President Obamaâ€™s plan to use his Oval Office powers to try to tighten gun-control laws, arguing his efforts are â€œunconstitutionalâ€ and another attempt to sidestep Congress.

"We're not changing the Second Amendment," front-running Donald Trump said Saturday at a campaign rally in Biloxi, Miss. "I will veto that. I will un-sign that so fast."

Obama said over the weekend that heâ€™ll meet Monday with Attorney General Loretta Lynch to discuss his options on tightening federal firearms laws to reduce gun violence, after instructing his White House team several months ago to look at what type of â€œactionâ€ he could take.

â€œThe president is a petulant child,â€ GOP candidate New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told â€œFox News Sunday.â€ â€œWhenever he doesnâ€™t get what he wants, â€¦ this president acts like a king.â€

Obama purportedly will use executive action to require small-scale gun sellers to order background checks on prospective buyers and tighten laws for gun sales to those who have committed domestic-abuse offenses.

â€œThe president has a pattern of taking away rights of citizens,â€ GOP candidate and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told â€œFox News Sunday.â€

Bush also suggested that he didnâ€™t object in principle to keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, but that he is wary of how far-reaching and burdensome the proposed changes might be on small-scale gun sellers.

â€œHow do you know?â€ he asked. â€œThe better approach would be to punish people who violate federal gun laws. â€¦ If itâ€™s such a great idea, let (Obama) go to Congress.â€

The president tried unsuccessfully in the aftermath of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, in Newtown, Conn., to get Congress to pass comprehensive gun control legislation.

The National Rifle Association, which opposed that plan, also opposes the new plan, calling it a â€œpolitical stunt.â€

Christie and others point out that Obama has tried to use executive action to allow illegal immigrants to remain in the United States and work. However, a federal appeals court has temporarily stopped that action, pending a final ruling.

â€œIâ€™m sure (the gun executive action) will get stopped by the courts,â€ Christie also said Sunday.

Trump, a billionaire businessman, on Sunday told CBSâ€™s â€œFace the Nationâ€ that if elected he would use the same executive powers to repeal Obamaâ€™s likely new executive orders on gun control.

â€œThe one thing good about executive orders: The new president, if he comes in -- boom, first day, first hour, first minute, you can rescind that,â€ he said.

GOP candidate Carly Fiorina told CNNâ€™s â€œState of the Unionâ€ that Obama â€œhas been a lawless presidentâ€ in his use of executive orders.

â€œIt is delusional, dangerous, not to mention unconstitutional,â€ she said. â€œWe have long lists of criminals who own guns, who routinely purchase guns. We know who these people are, and we are not prosecuting any of them.â€

The three Democratic presidential candidates -- Hillary Clinton, former Maryland Gov. Martin Oâ€™Malley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- support tighter gun control.

Sander told ABC's â€œThis Weekâ€ he wishes Obama could get bipartisan congressional support but that he supports the presidentâ€™s renewed efforts.

â€œThere is a wide consensus. (The) overwhelming majority of the American people believe we should expand and strengthen the instant background checks,â€ he said. â€œI think that's what the president is trying to do, and I think that will be the right thing to do.â€

Sanders also said he supports more background check, which would likely help close what gun-control advocates call the â€œgun show loophole" as well as strong measures to keep criminals and people with mental health issues from owning firearms.
