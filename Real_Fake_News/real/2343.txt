Kim Davis â€” the Rowan County, Kentucky Clerk who earlier today brazenly defied the Supreme Courtâ€™s order to issue marriage licenses citing â€œGodâ€™s authorityâ€ â€” has been ordered to stand before U.S. District Judge David Bunning on Thursday and explain why she shouldnâ€™t be jailed and fined for her actions.

In a statement released after she refused, for the fourth time, to issue David Moore and David Ermold a marriage license, Davis said that â€œ[t]o issue a marriage license which conflicts with Godâ€™s definition of marriage, with my name affixed to the certificate, would violate my conscience. It is not a light issue for me. It is a Heaven or Hell decision.â€

â€œI was elected by the people to serve as the County Clerk,â€ she continued, and â€œI intend to continue to serve the people of Rowan County, but I cannot violate my conscience.â€ That she is an elected official has become a point of contention, because as such she canâ€™t be fired for refusing to abide by the Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling. Removing her from office would entail impeachment proceedings, which will either have to wait until the next legislative session or require the calling of a special session, which could be prohibitively expensive.

In the meantime, no one in Rowan County will be issued a marriage licenses. Lawyers representing the four couples who were denied licenses told the Associated Press that â€œ[s]ince Defendant Davis continues to collect compensation from the Commonwealth for duties she fails to perform,â€ they want Judge Bunning to â€œimpose financial penalties sufficiently serious and increasingly onerousâ€ â€” but that they are not seeking for her to be jailed for contempt. The scene at Davisâ€™ office this morning was raucous, with supporters of both side lining the walkway into it and occupying the tiny building. â€œPraise the Lord!â€ yelled one, â€œStand your ground!â€ Another demanded Davis â€œDo your job!â€ One of her supporters was her husband, who noted that his family has received death threats and warned people that heâ€™s a firm believer in the Second Amendment. â€œIâ€™m an old redneck hillbilly,â€ he warned. â€œThatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve got to say. Donâ€™t come knocking on my door.â€ Watch video via the Courier-Journal below.
