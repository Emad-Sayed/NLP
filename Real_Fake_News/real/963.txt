The two presidents stood in the East Room on Tuesday afternoon, united in their goal of defeating the Islamic State but separated by a stylistic gulf as vast as the Atlantic.

On the left, facing the cameras, was Fran§ois Hollande, war president. He spoke of â€œcowardly murderersâ€ who â€œdishonor humanity,â€ of a â€œrelentless determination to fight terrorism everywhere and anywhere,â€ of â€œan implacable joint response,â€ of â€œhunting down their leadersâ€ and â€œtaking back the land.â€

On the right stood Barack Obama, President Oh-bummer.

â€œThatâ€™s going to be a process that involves hard, methodical work. Itâ€™s not going to be something that happens just because suddenly we take a few more airstrikes.â€

â€œItâ€™s going to be hard. And we should not be under any illusions.â€

Could the Paris attacks have been prevented?

Obama, in Turkey last week, responded to those who believe he isnâ€™t tough enough on the Islamic State. â€œSome of them seem to think that if I was just more bellicose in expressing what weâ€™re doing, that that would make a difference,â€ he said.

Tough talk wonâ€™t defeat terrorists â€” but it will rally a nation. Itâ€™s no mere coincidence that the unpopular Hollandeâ€™s support has increased during his forceful response to the attacks, while Obamaâ€™s poll numbers are down.

The importance of language was very clear at the White House on Tuesday, even in translation.

There was little difference in their strategies for fighting the Islamic State, but Hollande was upbeat and can-do, while Obama was discouraging and lawyerly. It was as if the smoke-â€™em-out spirit of George W. Bush had been transplanted into the body of a short, pudgy, bespectacled French socialist with wrinkled suit-pants.

From my fourth-row perspective, Obama was still and contained, while Hollandeâ€™s sweeping gestures kept setting off bursts of camera-shutter clicks. The Frenchman brought Mediterranean heat (â€œdismantle and destroyâ€), while the American was Lakeâ€‰Michigan-cool (â€œThere is a potential convergence of interests between the various partiesâ€).

Itâ€™s not as if Obama lacks emotion (he rubbed his face and appeared to blink back tears as Hollande spoke of the young American woman killed in the Paris attacks) or passion (he spoke movingly about the need to admit Syrian refugees). But when he spoke of war and terrorism, it was to play down and reassure. â€œMy fellow Americans, letâ€™s remember we faced greater threats to our way of life before,â€ he said.

Obama had moments of loft in his lengthy opening statement. He spoke of the â€œmurderousâ€ Islamic State and the â€œmadnessâ€ of terrorism as a â€œscourge that threatens us all.â€ It â€œmust be destroyed,â€ he said. But he turned defensive when he reminded everybody that a 65-nation coalition has been fighting the Islamic State â€œfor more than a year,â€ and he recited its â€œprogress.â€ Later, Obama said the task was to â€œaccelerateâ€ the â€œsuccessâ€ already seen. Rather than a new approach, Obama said the United States and allies â€œmust do even more.â€

Hollande â€” whose capital, after all, is the one that was just attacked â€” had a greater sense of urgency. â€œThe Paris attacks generated a lot of emotion, but thatâ€™s not enough,â€ he said. â€œWe must act. And for a number of days now, I have been trying to convince, convincing all the countries that can act, to do so. .â€‰.â€‰. Today I am here with Barack so that we can act with greater intensity and coherence as well.â€

Asked about Turkey shooting down a Russian military plane, the two men had the same response â€” to avoid escalation â€” but voiced it in very different ways. The cerebral Obama said â€œthis underscores the importance of us making sure that we move this political track forward.â€ The visceral Hollande said, â€œThe only purpose is to fight against terrorismâ€ and the Islamic State.

When Laura Haim of Franceâ€™s Canal+ TV network asked if there was a deadline for ousting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, both men had the same policy: no timetable. But what they said after that highlighted their different styles.

Hollande spoke of a new era. â€œThere is a new mind-set now,â€ Hollande said. â€œAnd those who believed that we could waitâ€ now realize â€œthe risk is everywhere . .â€‰.â€‰. We, therefore, must act.â€

â€œSyria has broken down,â€ he said. â€œAnd it is going to be a difficult, long, methodical process to bring back together various factions within Syria to maintain a Syrian state.â€

Maybe you can motivate people when you sound so discouraging. But itâ€™s hard.
