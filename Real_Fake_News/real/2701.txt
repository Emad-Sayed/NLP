Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has made no secret of the fact that he spanks his daughter when she misbehaves. He has also suggested the American people should deliver a â€œspankingâ€ to Hillary Clinton.

Now, he is prescribing the same discipline for a protester who interrupted him during a rally in Indiana on Sunday.

â€œApparently thereâ€™s a young man whoâ€™s having some problems,â€ Cruz said as the man yelled: â€œYou suck!â€

â€œThank you, son,â€ Cruz replied, before adding that he believes â€œchildren should actually speak with respect.â€

â€œImagine what a different world it would be if someone had told Donald Trump that years ago,â€ he said. â€œYou know, in my household, when a child behaves that way, they get a spanking.â€

The exchange comes as Cruz and Trump are stumping for every last vote heading into to the Republican primary in Indiana on Tuesday. Trump leads Cruz by roughly 9 percentage points, 42%-32.7%, in the RealClearPolitics average of recent Hoosier polls. A win there could help solidify Trumpâ€™s claim to the nomination, while dealing Cruz a formidable blow.
