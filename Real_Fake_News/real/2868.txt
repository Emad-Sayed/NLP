Doesnâ€™t mean we go around committing hate crimes

-- â€œEveryoneâ€™s A Little Bit Racistâ€ from the Tony award winning Broadway musical â€œAvenue Qâ€

Congressional Republicans might not be capable of directly measuring their tolerance of Donald Trump. But there is certainly a metric that helps them gauge the amount.

Most Republicans have gone along grudgingly with Trump -- if they support the presumptive presidential nominee at all. Some of those lawmakers are now reviewing that political quotient as they wonder what Trump might say next.

They ponder how many more times theyâ€™ll have to condemn Trumpâ€™s remarks. They ask themselves if theyâ€™ll again have to awkwardly criticize Trumpâ€™s comments about a judge or women or Muslims -- yet reaffirm allegiance to him in the next breath.

Only Trump knows what lies in his heart when it comes to race, ethnicity and religion. But some of his comments give people pause and perhaps make them think of the lyrics in the Avenue Q tune. No, Trump doesnâ€™t â€œgo around committing hate crimes.â€ But his comments certainly sound â€œa little bit racistâ€ to some and â€œa lotta bit racistâ€ to others.

House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions, R-Texas, says heâ€™ll vote for Trump. But he adds that Trump needs to alter his rhetoric. And if Trump keeps it up?

â€œIt causes a lot of us to think,â€ Sessions responded.

Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune, South Dakota, said Trumpâ€™s â€œgoing to have to adapt. â€¦ This is not working for him.â€

This has been an unconventional election year because it flips political norms on their ear. But political capital still exists and isnâ€™t unlimited.

Republicans cannot repeatedly find themselves crossways with the top of their ticket, blasting Trumpâ€™s provocative language yet failing to disavow that person and their ideals. Political capital is fungible, and some of Republicans could see their own stock plunge if they are linked too closely to Trump.

â€œIâ€™m not going to be sucked into talking about Trump 24/7,â€ protested Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, when asked about the Trumpâ€™s views that federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel is incapable of fairly adjudicating a lawsuit involving Trump University because he is â€œMexican.â€

Never mind that Curiel was born in Indiana to Hispanic parents.

Cornyn says Republicans should focus instead on policy and the issues. But try as they might, the GOP fights a powerful political news vacuum that insists on focusing on Trump and his missteps â€œ24/7.â€

At the Senate Republican leadership press conference Tuesday afternoon, just outside the Senate chamber, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke about plans to finish a defense bill this week (which didnâ€™t happen).

The leader mentioned opioid and energy measures. Cornyn then spoke about defense and North Korea. Thune cited the Iran nuclear deal and ISIS. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, discussed the economy and job numbers.

And then reporters ignored the leadership boilerplate and asked four consecutive questions about Trump.

â€œIâ€™m going to let you all try one more time,â€ beseeched an exasperated McConnell to the press corps.

Naturally, journalists fired a fifth sidewinder interrogative at McConnell about Trumpâ€™s invective â€œovershadowingâ€ the GOP agenda and the ability of Congress to legislate.

â€œOK. Iâ€™m going to wrap it up with this,â€ huffed McConnell, who turned his ire on Trump. â€œItâ€™s time to quit attacking various people that you competed with or various minority groups in the country and get on message. He has an opportunity to do that. This election is eminently winnable.â€

â€œWeâ€™re all anxious to hear what he might say next,â€ said the Kentucky Republican.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., didnâ€™t fare much better when he spoke Tuesday in inner-city Washington at an event rolling out the GOPâ€™s anti-poverty plan.

Naturally, the first question focused on Trump, forcing the speaker to characterize the remarks about Curiel as â€œthe textbook definition of a racist comment.â€

One Republican lawmaker hit the ceiling with Trump earlier in the week.

Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., faces perhaps the most-challenging re-election campaign of any GOP senator this fall.

Kirk this week dropped his support for Trump. He said the first-time candidate and billionaire businessman â€œhas not demonstrated the temperament necessary to be president.â€

Kirk also said he wouldnâ€™t support Hillary Clinton for president. When asked who he might back, Kirk initially said â€œno oneâ€ before quickly adding he would â€œwrite-in David Petraeus.â€

Trump then published a statement that failed to extinguish the flames on the Curiel comments. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., doesnâ€™t support Trump. The new statement vexed the senator.

â€œThis is a new level,â€ Flake said. â€œHe needs to retract.â€

A reporter asked Flake whether he thought Trump had sufficiently â€œwalked backâ€ the Curiel remarks.

Not all congressional Republicans are able or willing to tell Trump to take a hike.

Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., says Trump would throttle Clinton in his district on eastern Long Island. Zeldin wants reporters to focus on the issues and not Trumpâ€™s words.

â€œItâ€™s a disservice for any presidential campaign and those following it who is not doing a deep dive on substantive issues,â€ argued Zeldin.

But it was Zeldin who found himself crossways in a CNN interview about his own word choice.

â€œYou can easily argue that the president of the United States is a racist with his policies and rhetoric,â€ he said.

When confronted by reporters in a congressional hallway the next day, Zeldin wanted to revert to substantive issues.

â€œThereâ€™s a lot more to this presidential race then just analyzing what the most provocative thing of the day was said,â€ Zeldin said.

Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., defended Trump when reporters asked whether the candidateâ€™s statements disqualified him for president.

Reporters pressed Perdue on whether Trumpâ€™s comments could wound him with voters.

â€œPeople back home arenâ€™t worried about that,â€ said Perdue, noting that he disagreed with Trumpâ€™s â€œtonality.â€

Tone is indeed an issue for Trump. And as McConnell and even Zeldin suggested, so is substance.

After the weekly Capitol Hill huddle of the pro-Trump caucus Thursday morning, Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., remarked that Trump would â€œbe on message on policy.

Heâ€™s going to take the fight to Hillary Clinton.â€ Collins also asserted â€œweâ€™re going to be disciplined.â€

Exiting the same session, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said that Trump was now playing ball in â€œa much tougher league.â€

â€œYouâ€™ve got to be more careful and youâ€™ve got to think through

 what youâ€™re going to say,â€ he said.

Within hours, Trump reverted to name-calling. He upbraided Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and called her â€œPocahontas,â€ referring to a 2012 dispute about whether she has Native American roots.

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, had an idea on how to fix things for Trump.

â€œYou folks in the media need to give him a little more leeway,â€ suggested Hatch, third in line to the presidency as the Senateâ€™s resident pro tempore.

Sen Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., isnâ€™t supporting Trump. He argues thereâ€™s a limited threshold for how much political capital some GOPers are willing to burn if Trump continues the trash talk.

â€œIf he keeps doing this heâ€™s really dishonoring that support,â€ Graham said.

Thatâ€™s the political risk Trump poses to his own supporters -- especially in Republicans in Congress.

Lawmakers donâ€™t want the public to perceive them like someone out of Avenue Q. As the song goes, no oneâ€™s going around â€œcommitting hate crimes.â€

But if Trump continues the rhetoric, lawmakers worry voters could label Republicans â€œa little bit racist.â€
