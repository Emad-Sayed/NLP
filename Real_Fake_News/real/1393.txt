On Monday, Cotton drafted a letter â€” signed by 46 other senators â€” addressed to â€œleaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran,â€ warning that any deal reached on the countryâ€™s nuclear program could be killed by the next administration â€œwith the stroke of a pen.â€ The letter generated fierce criticism not only from the Obama administration and congressional Democrats, but also from conservative quarters, including the Wall Street Journalâ€™s editorial board, which Kelly noted called Cottonâ€™s correspondence a â€œdistraction.â€

â€œWell, on the contrary, Megyn, I think that this debate weâ€™re having is incredibly important and helpful to raising just what a bad deal President Obama is about to make with Iran,â€ Cotton responded. â€œThe last two days, weâ€™ve focused on the terms of the deal, which is: One, President Obama will accept a 10-year sunset clause; and two, he has conceded a vast uranium enrichment capability to Iran that paves the way for Iran to get the bomb, as Prime Minister Netanyahu said last week,â€ he added, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s inflammatory March 3 address before Congress.

Kelly pressed: â€œBut whatâ€™s the point in writing to the Iranian mullahs? What are you gonna do?â€ She noted that many in the Iranian leadership have dismissed Cottonâ€™s letter, while he has irked the Obama administration and even alienated congressional Democrats skeptical of the nuclear talks. â€œMegyn, if you talk to most Iran experts, theyâ€™ll tell you that Iranâ€™s leaders donâ€™t understand our constitutional system,â€ Cotton answered. â€œSo we need to be crystal clear with the leaders of Iran: Any deal thatâ€™s not approved by Congress wonâ€™t be accepted by Congress,â€ he later said. Kelly continued to emphasize that if Cotton is so keen on congressional review, offending Democrats in Congress may not be the optimal way to go about the matter. For his part, Cotton asserted that he wants Democrats to join his effort, effectively torpedoing diplomacy and reprimanding their president. Good luck with that.
