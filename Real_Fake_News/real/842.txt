In several surreptitiously recorded video conversations, Scott Foval, the former national field director at Americans United for Change, admits to â€œbird doggingâ€ â€” planting agitators at â€” Donald Trumpâ€™s rallies to draw negative media attention.

Foval describes colluding with Bob Creamer, co-founder of consulting group Democracy Partners, to â€œput people in the line, at the front . . . to get in front at the rally, so that when Trump comes down the rope line, theyâ€™re the ones asking him the question in front of the reporter, because theyâ€™re pre-placed there.â€

â€œTo funnel that kind of operation, you have to start back with people two weeks ahead of time and train them how to ask questions,â€ Foval explains. â€œYou have to train them to bird dog.â€

Among Fovalâ€™s trainees, he says, are â€œmentally ill people, that we pay to do shit.â€

â€œOver the last 20 years, Iâ€™ve paid off a few homeless guys to do some crazy stuff, and Iâ€™ve also taken them for dinner, and Iâ€™ve also made sure they had a hotel, and a shower.  And I put them in a program,â€ he brags. â€œLike, Iâ€™ve done that.â€

Americans United for Change subsequently cut ties with Foval, according to a statement from the groupâ€™s head, Brad Woodhouse.

Oâ€™Keefe and Project Veritas have been criticized in the past, however, for strategically editing footage to make false accusations.

In 2013, Oâ€™Keefe settled a suit for $100,000 after editing a recording with an ACORN employee who subsequently lost his job. Similarly, after Oâ€™Keefe and an associate posed as donors affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood in a sting operation at NPR, The Blaze examined the edited video against the raw footage and found manipulative editing.

And contrary to former New York City mayor Rudy Giulianiâ€™s hunch, political trickery (real or alleged) isnâ€™t exclusive to either party. In August, Politico reported that Steven Wessel, a convicted con man unaffiliated with Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign, â€œcatfishedâ€ the Republican presidential nomineeâ€™s opponents to gather information â€œabout the operatives and their intentions regarding Trump.â€ Assuming a variety of fake online identities, including that of a female solicitor in England, Wessel gushed in emails, phone calls and Twitter messages about (made-up) extramarital affairs with the likes of the late Lee Atwater, showered marks with gift cards to the swanky Mandarin Oriental, and invited them to go pheasant-hunting in Scotland â€” all in an apparent attempt to glean more about the operatives and their intentions regarding Trump. Among Wesselâ€™s targets: Republicans Rick Wilson and Cheri Jacobus, and libertarian consultant Liz Mair. According to the report, â€œThe targets of the scheme do not believe that Wessel, described by his own lawyer as mentally ill, was acting alone.â€ â€œThe questions were of such a degree of granularity and specificity and political acumen that unless [Wessel] had political experience it would be hard for him to come up with them,â€ said Wilson, head of a pro-Sen. Marco Rubio super PAC during the primaries. Wilson â€œsuggested the possible involvementâ€ of the defunct Make America Great Again PAC. The second installment of undercover videos is scheduled to drop Tuesday.
