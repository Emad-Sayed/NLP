SALT LAKE CITYâ€”The revelations of recent days about Donald Trumpâ€™s lascivious and predatory attitudes toward women have hurt him in Utah perhaps more than any other state.

Julie de Azevedo Hanks, a psychotherapist with a blog that is widely read in the Mormon community, is an independent who voted for Mitt Romney four years ago. She planned to keep her preference for Hillary Clinton quiet until she saw the 2005 video of the Republican nominee boasting to Billy Bush about pursuing married women and using his celebrity to make unwanted advances.

â€œThat tape put the final nail in the coffin,â€ Hanks said. â€œA year ago, I never would have thought Iâ€™d be voting for her. I know sheâ€™s not flawless. I donâ€™t idolize her. I donâ€™t have rose-colored glasses. â€¦ We may not get everything we value with Hillary, but she aligns more closely with what we do value than Trump.â€

Hanks posted on her blog about how dangerous she thinks Trump would be as president. She said her husband, a rock-ribbed Republican, may just not vote at all now. Last night, she was one of nearly 70 volunteers who showed up to phone bank at Clintonâ€™s Utah headquarters, on the outskirts of the capital of one of the countryâ€™s reddest states.

The parking lot overflowed. Volunteers â€“ many who identify as independent or even Republican â€“ parked down nearby residential streets and walked. They ate Little Caesarâ€™s Pizza as they made the case on cell phones to their Utah neighbors to back a Democrat for president for the first time since 1964.

The Clinton team has a full-time staffer on the ground to organize the phone banks and canvassing. Theyâ€™ve even launched a Mormons for Hillary effort.

The influential Deseret News, which is owned by the Mormon Church, has stayed out of presidential politics for 80 years. But the editorial board urged all of its readers over the weekend not to vote for Trump. (For context, more than six in 10 voters in next monthâ€™s election will be members of the flock.)

â€œWhat oozes from this audio is evil,â€ the editorial said. â€œTrumpâ€™s banter belies a willingness to use and discard other human beings at will. That characteristic is the essence of a despot.â€

Republican Gov. Gary Herbert and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, both Mormons, withdrew their support last Friday just hours after The Post published the video. Sen. Mike Lee, who is up for reelection, also called for the reality TV star to drop out, prompting an avalanche of colleagues to follow.

A former Miss Teen Utah is one of the women who has come forward to accuse Trump of boorish behavior in the days since. (Trump denies any wrongdoing.)

-- Romney, who is Mormon, got 73 percent of the vote here four years ago. Trump got just 34 percent of the vote in a Monmouth University poll published yesterday. He leads Clinton by only 6 points (she pulled 28 percent). Another 20 percent back independent Evan McMullin, who joined the race at the urging of Never Trump conservatives, and 9 percent support Libertarian Gary Johnson. The survey was in the field after the emergence of the 2005 tape but before numerous additional women came forward to accuse Trump of misconduct.

Just 19 percent of likely voters view Trump favorably. Seven in 10 do not believe he has the temperament to be president. Six in 10 Republicans and three in four Mormons say he does not share their values.

-- I interviewed more than 30 voters on the ground over the past two days, and it feels like he has not yet hit bottom.

-- The alternatives to Trump are racing to capitalize on his collapse in the Beehive State. Both McMullin and Johnson are running their national campaigns out of Salt Lake City, trying to become the first non-major-party candidate since 1968 to win any stateâ€™s electoral votes.

McMullin, who is focusing more on Utah than any other state, is a 40-year-old Mormon who spent a decade at the CIA and later became the policy director for the House Republican Conference. â€œPeople are finally realizing the truth about Trump,â€ he said during an interview at his campaign headquarters yesterday afternoon. â€œI imagine there are dozens more of these women out there, sadly.â€

The first-time candidate presents himself as the antithesis of Trump. He talked about â€œthe positives of immigration.â€ He said he really wants to win over Muslims. He decried stop-and-frisk policing as â€œbased on racism.â€ And he heavily criticized both major-party nominees.

â€œBoth of these candidates, under other circumstances, might find themselves in jail,â€ McMullin said, taking a sip of a Diet Coke. â€œEither Donald Trump for sexual assault or Hillary Clinton for violating our laws on protecting classified information. So the debate is about who has abused women more and who is more corrupt. It is horrible that we find ourselves in this position.â€

McMullin last week tapped Mindy Finn, a D.C.-based digital media strategist, to be his running mate. â€œWe hear from a lot of our supporters that we are an answer to their prayers,â€ she said. â€œThey can walk out of the polling booth with their head held high. â€¦ The Republican Party has lost its way. Itâ€™s eating itself alive by normalizing the behavior of Trump. â€¦ What exists here is a lifeboat.â€

-- Utah was always a bad fit for Trump. Most Mormons spend two years overseas as missionaries, which gives them a more internationalist outlook. Because the early church faced so much persecution, Trumpâ€™s support for religious tests cause visceral disgust. The state welcomes refugees with open arms. In contrast to the Rust Belt, there are vastly more opportunities for upward mobility and the unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the country.

Boyd Matheson, who runs a local conservative think tank called the Sutherland Institute, believes McMullin can win. â€œUtahns are not an angry people,â€ he said. â€œThe hunker-down protectionism that Trump is offering just doesnâ€™t ring true here. â€¦ For a lot of people who were never excited about Trump, the video locked it in.â€

-- But McMullinâ€™s immediate problem is that two-thirds of Utahns have still not heard of him. â€œWe want to prevail in Utah, but we have a lot of work to do,â€ he said at a sparsely-decorated campaign office that is next door to a Thai restaurant and across from a credit union. Without much fundraising, heâ€™s focusing on free media coverage and digital efforts. He said there has been a 1,600 percent increase in online engagement over the past four days. â€œWe saw a marked shift with the tape,â€ he said.

-- The other big issue is that if the anti-Trump vote is divided, like it was throughout the GOP nominating contest, the reality TV star could eke out a narrow win. Johnson has campaigned hard in Utah. He was back in the state Wednesday night and has come at least once every few weeks since the start of the year. During the interview, McMullin sought to dismiss Johnson as a spoiler of sorts: â€œHe has some impact, but this is a three-way race.â€

Johnsonâ€™s communications director Joe Hunter responded that the former New Mexico governor will appear on the ballot in all 50 states while McMullin has only qualified to appear in 11 states. â€œHeâ€™s kind of running for president of Utah, and thatâ€™s legit,â€ Hunter, who lives up the road in Park City, said of McMullin. â€œThereâ€™s nothing wrong with that strategy. But weâ€™re more confident in ours. â€¦ Weâ€™re ultimately the best option for the Never Trump Republicans in Utah.â€

Everyone says a late endorsement from someone like Romney might help voters coalesce behind either McMullin or Johnson and put them over the top. â€œAll the people you would wonder about, Iâ€™m talking to most of them,â€ McMullin said when asked if heâ€™s in touch with the 2012 GOP nominee (who is legendary here because he turned around Salt Lake Cityâ€™s failing 2002 Olympics).

-- To be sure, Clinton has a very narrow path to victory in such a conservative state. Sheâ€™s viewed unfavorably by almost the same percentage of voters as Trump. Only 25 percent said they like her in the Monmouth poll. And she lost the caucuses here this spring to Bernie Sanders.

But Peter Corroon, the chairman of the Utah Democratic Party, said his team is mobilizing a bigger get-out-the-vote operation than ever before, knocking on hundreds of thousands of doors and making hundreds of thousands of phone calls. â€œIt probably wonâ€™t be over 30 percent of the vote, but I think sheâ€™ll get the plurality,â€ said Corroon, the former mayor of Salt Lake City. â€œEvery time Trump opens his mouth, it gets worse for him here. â€¦ Some will move to Hillary, and McMullin and Johnson are splitting the third-party votes.â€

Republicans like to point out that, in 1992, Bill Clinton finished in third place (with 25 percent of the vote) behind George H.W. Bush and Ross Perot. Mike Lee says he still has not made up his mind about who to vote for, but it will not be Trump or Clinton. When I asked him if thereâ€™s any way she could prevail, he did not hesitate. â€œNo,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s not going to happen.â€

But itâ€™s also true that third-party candidates typically underperform how they do in pre-election polling because they do not have the same kind of organization to get out the vote.

The Clinton outreach also extends to Utah's growing Hispanic population, especially those living in the state's 4th Congressional District, represented by Rep. Mia Love (R). Statewide, Hispanics comprise about 8 percent of eligible voters, but in Love's district they account for about 25 percent. That was enough to prompt Lorella Praeli, the campaign's Latino voter outreach director, to travel here last month to meet with local volunteers and activists. As in other states with smaller, but growing, Hispanic populations like North Carolina and Pennsylvania, the Clinton campaign thinks running up the score with this constituency could wind up being decisive.

-- Clinton campaign strategists freely acknowledge that Utah is a reach, and that it is easier to pick off states like Arizona or Georgia first. Both sides agree that, if Trump loses here, the election nationally will probably be a blowout. But if for some reason it is close, and the divided third-party votes allow her to win in a squeaker, Utahâ€™s six electoral votes (the same number as Iowa has) could cut off several other paths Trump has to get to 270.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- The Nationals season is over after they fell to the Dodgers 4-3 in Game 5. Los Angeles scored all four runs in the seventh inning. â€œWe just came up short,â€ manager Dusty Baker said. â€œIâ€™m proud of my guys, of how they played this year.â€ (Jorge Castillo)

-- A Fox News poll shows Clinton up 7 points (45-38) over Trump, up from just 2 points last week. More than half of Americans now say Trump is unqualified to be president. "If the Republicans are not at rock-bottom, they can certainly see the bottom from where they are," says GOP pollster Daron Shaw. "If Trump got 90 percent of self-identified Republicans and nothing else -- no Democrats and no independents -- he'd be at 32 percent.â€

-- Clinton is up 4 points in North Carolina and Ohio is virtually tied in NBC/WSJ/Marist polling. Sen. Richard Burr is tied with Democratic challenger Deborah Ross at 46 percent in the Tar Heel State. Rob Portman continues to dominate in the Buckeye State, leading Democratic challenger Ted Strickland by 18 (55-37).

-- A SurveyUSA poll in Texas found that Trumpâ€™s lead has receded to just 4 points in the Lone Star State, which is within the margin of error. For perspective, Romney won the state by 16 points in 2012, McCain by 13, and George W. Bush by 23. Ted Cruz is not popular back home: Only 45 percent approve, compared to 45 percent who disapprove. "It suggests that he may be looking at a significant primary challenge,â€ said SMU professor Matthew Wilson. Separately, Texas has a record-breaking 15 million people registered to vote ahead of the election, the Texas Tribune reports â€“ more than 777,000 more than were registered for the March primaries.

-- Trump is pulling out of Virginia. NBC News reports that the news was announced to staff on a Wednesday night conference call and left many operatives on the ground blindsided. The decision came from Trumpâ€™s headquarters in New York and means that he is running essentially a four state campaign in the final three weeks, focusing on Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.

â€œSeveral factors appear to have pushed Virginia into the Clinton column,â€ Laura Vozzella explains from Richmond: â€œChanging demographics that favor Democrats in statewide elections; divisions within the state Republican Party over Trump; Clintonâ€™s selection of Sen. Tim Kaine, a well-liked former Virginia governor as her running mate; and vigorous support from Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a close Clinton friend. â€We got so far ahead here that we are no longer considered a swing state in Clinton World,â€™ McAuliffe told The Post in an interview last week â€” before the release of a tape of Trump bragging about groping women.â€

-- Paul Ryan is attempting to move past his week-long battle with Trump today by delivering a fresh policy speech and announcing that he helped raise an additional $15.4 million to defend the House GOP majority. Kelsey Snell has early excerpts: â€œRyan will argue for the value of conservative leadership in Congress in a mid-day address to college Republicans in his home state of Wisconsin. The speech aims to refocus the political discussion on the same traditional Republican themes like small government and freedom that Ryan has seen as key to maintaining a GOP majority as support [for] Trump has been sinking. â€It is important that we take a step back and reflect on what this election is ultimately about,â€™ Ryan will say. â€Beneath all the ugliness lies a long running debate between two governing philosophies: one that is in keeping with our nationâ€™s founding principlesâ€”like freedom and equalityâ€”and another that seeks to replace them.â€™"

-- The RNC raised $39.4 million in September and has transferred $6.35 million of that to fund down-ballot races. From Bloombergâ€™s Kevin Cirilli: â€œThe reallocation of $6.35 millionâ€”$4.5 million of which went to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and $1.85 million to the National Republican Congressional Committeeâ€”was made â€with the encouragement of the Trump campaign,â€™ the RNC's press release stated.â€

-- Elsewhere, a group of the Republican Partyâ€™s most generous donors are calling on the RNC to disavow Trump, saying the latest allegations about his sexual misconduct are grounds for the committee to cut ties, finally and fully. From The New York Timesâ€™ Jonathan Martin, Alexander Burns, and Maggie Haberman: â€œThe Republican financial apparatus under Mr. Priebus, sputtering since Mr. Trump claimed the presidential nomination, is wheezing painfully in the final weeks of the race. The committeeâ€™s fund-raising officials now quietly acknowledge that Mr. Trump is a thoroughly compromised candidate, party donors said, but implore potential contributors to give anyway, stressing graver concerns like control of the Supreme Court. Many donors have stopped giving, though, and some have deserted the party, including two major donors who confirmed on Thursday that they were supporting Gary Johnson â€¦ Even some of Mr. Priebusâ€™s allies believe that Mr. Trump is certain to be defeated and that it is time for the party to protect its image by disavowing him.â€

-- Those who know him best are not giving him money --> â€œTrump's missing donors: the people who work for him,â€ by Michelle Conlin and Grant Smith at Reuters: â€œKerry Woolard, the 37-year-old manager of Trump Winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, went online in June and made her first political contribution: A $250 donation to the campaign of her boss, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Woolard's donation was unusual. Only a dozen of an estimated 22,450 people employed at Trump's companies have donated more than $200 to the celebrity businessman's bid for the U.S. presidency, [according to a Reuters review] â€¦â€ The contributors have given a total amount of $5,298 to Trump's campaign, a fraction of the $112 million Trump's political operation has received this year. This stands in stark contrast to the 2012 election, when employees at the private equity firm Mitt Romney led until 1999, Bain Capital, and a separate company for which he worked, Bain & Company, donated nearly $375,000. Bain Capital employees gave an additional $1.125 million to Romney's Super PAC.â€

-- How toxic is Trump? Florida GOP Rep. David Jolly, who represents an area around Tampa, is threatening to sue the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee over a campaign ad that uses multiple photo-shopped pictures of him and Trump, portraying a close relationship between the two -- though they have never met in person. "I have never met Donald Trump. I have never had a conversation with Donald Trump. I have never been in a room with Donald Trump," said Jolly, who has refused to endorse Trump but is nevertheless expected to lose to Charlie Crist. (Miami Herald)

-- Trump spent Thursday afternoon issuing a stunning call to arms, emphatically denying a wave of new groping allegations while charging that his accusers were instead conspiring against him. From Philip Rucker and Sean Sullivan: â€œScrambling to turn around his floundering campaign, Trump declared war on the media and multinational corporations, alleging they are colluding with [Clinton] to orchestrate â€the single greatest pile-on in history.'" â€œThe Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure,â€ he said at a Palm Beach rally. â€œAnyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe and morally deformed."

-- This is part of a pattern: When he gets desperate, Trump spins conspiracy theories. From Sean Sullivan: â€œThis time, there was a bigger, badder villain â€” â€a global power structureâ€™ of corporate interests, the media and Clinton engaging in subterfuge. This time, it was about him. Trump said Thursday that the world had reached â€a moment of reckoning.â€™ He told his backers that his campaign is â€not about me; itâ€™s about all of you, and itâ€™s about our country.â€™ He portrayed the powers he says have banded together to rally against him and his advocates as ruthless and cunning. â€They will attack you; they will slander you; they will seek to destroy your career and your family; they will seek to destroy everything about you, including your reputation,â€™ Trump said. â€They will lie, lie, lie, and then again they will do worse than that; they will do whatever is necessary.â€™â€

-- His speech came just minutes after Michelle Obama delivered a scathing, impassioned repudiation of Trumpâ€™s behavior, saying the groping allegations have â€œshaken her to her core.â€ The dueling speeches made for a remarkable moment in a roiling presidential campaign and signaled that the final 25 days would focus "not on policy or ideology, but on character. â€œTwo speeches. Two Americas. A pair of apocalyptic arguments and one call to burn down the house. Thatâ€™s the summation from just two remarkable hours Thursday that crystallized the final month of Campaign 2016,â€ Dan Balz writes. â€œIn back-to-back appearances, in what might be the two most compelling hours of the entire election, Michelle Obama in New Hampshire and Donald Trump in Florida delivered the fiercest, most provocative and hardest-hitting speeches of an election cycle that has been without precedent in hot rhetoric. The presidential campaign has been building toward all this. Day after day after day, the rhetoric has intensified, the charges and countercharges have escalated, the issues have been reduced to asterisks, and the gulf between the Trump and Clinton coalitions has widened. Sundayâ€™s debate in St. Louis foreshadowed what was to come. Now there will be no turning back.â€

-- Trump today will broaden his attack against the media to hit globalism and the Clinton Foundation by charging that Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim is part of the biased coalition working in collusion with the Clinton campaign, the Wall Street Journalâ€™s Monica Langley reports. â€œAs early as Friday, Mr. Trump is planning to claim that Mr. Slim, as a shareholder of New York Times Co. and donor to the Clinton Foundation, has an interest in helping Clintonâ€™s campaign â€¦ The Slim family held about 17% of the New York Times Class A shares as of March, making them the largest individual shareholder. Mr. Slim and his foundation have given between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation since its founding. Attacking the Mexican billionaire would allow Mr. Trump to hit several targets. He could slam the â€failingâ€™ New York Times, which he says had to be â€rescuedâ€™ by a â€foreignerâ€™â€”Mr. Slim, a [Trump adviser] said.â€

Slim and the Times pushed back quickly: â€œThis is totally false,â€ said Arturo Elias, Slimâ€™s spokesman. â€œOf course we arenâ€™t interfering in the U.S. election. We arenâ€™t even active in Mexican politics.â€ He said the contributions by Slim to the Clinton Foundation were a matter of public record. â€œCarlos Slim is an excellent shareholder who fully respects boundaries regarding the independence of our journalism,â€ said Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. â€œHe has never sought to influence what we report.â€

-- Die-hard Trump supporters have become angrier than ever. â€œCrowds that once booed and shouted at the press mainly at Trumpâ€™s prompting â€¦ have now begun spontaneously targeting the press on their own, at a scale not yet seen in this campaign, or any in memory on American soil,â€ says Politicoâ€™s Ben Schreckinger, who has covered the campaign for more than a year. â€œChants of â€CNN sucksâ€™ have become commonplace at Trump's rallies this week and members of the traveling press were called â€whoresâ€™ and â€press-titutesâ€™ as they filed out of a Thursday afternoon rally in West Palm Beach. This week, Trump has begun claiming that mainstream media outlets no longer conduct journalism. â€Reporters who work for these outlets like Washington Post or The New York Times may think of themselves as journalists, but theyâ€™re actually just cogs in a corporate, political machine,â€™ he said in Panama City."

-- One woman told HuffPost that she witnessed Trump looking up modelâ€™s skirts and commenting on their underwear at a 1996 dinner with mutual friends. Their group was seated at a semi-circular table, Lisa Boyne recounted, and the women couldnâ€™t get up without Trump and his friend getting up â€“ which they refused to do. â€œInstead, Boyne said, Trump insisted that the women walk across the table, allowing him to peer up their skirts while they did so. Trump â€œstuck his head right underneath their skirts,â€ Boyne said, and commented on whether they were wearing underwear and what their genitalia looked like.

-- Three longtime â€œApprenticeâ€ staffers told The Daily Beast that Trump repeatedly called deaf actress Marlee Matlin â€œretarded,â€ saying he regularly disrespected her and treated her as if she was mentally disabled. â€œHe would make fun of her voice. It actually sounded a lot like what he did [to] the New York Times guy,â€ said a former Apprentice employee. In another incident, Trump scribbled in the margins of a note on set: â€œMarlee, is she retarded?â€

-- Creepy: In 1992, Trump spotted a pair of girls singing Christmas carols at the Plaza hotel and asked them how old they were. When they said 14, Trump, then 46, replied, â€œWow! Just think â€” in a couple of years, I'll be dating you!" (LA Times)

-- Trump canceled a Sean Hannity interview that was scheduled for Fox News last night, perhaps to avoid having to answer for the latest allegations. A spokesman said it would be â€œrescheduled.â€ (Politico)

-- â€œThese women plan to vote for Trump, despite his lewd comments,â€ by Mary Jordan in North Carolina: â€œIf Clinton becomes the first female president of the United States, a lot of women at Grannyâ€™s Country Kitchen will be upset. They know Trump has said crude things about women. He may even have behaved like a lout. But when forced to weigh Trumpâ€™s behavior against their disdain for Clinton, the women at Grannyâ€™s say itâ€™s not even close. A growing gender gap is marking the 2016 campaign. Not since CBS News exit polls were first taken in 1972 has there been such a divide in how men and women view candidates.â€ But perhaps more unexpected than women abandoning Trump are those who still enthusiastically support him. â€¦ â€Is it offensive? Yes. Can we forgive it? Yes!â€™ Debbie Meadows, wife of Rep. Mark Meadows (N.C.), said of Trumpâ€™s remarks. Rep. Ted Yohoâ€™s wife agreed: â€When I found out, I had a few moments of righteous indignation,â€™ she said. â€Then I got some perspective.â€™â€

-- The Times responded to a letter from Trumpâ€™s lawyers that called their sexual assault story "libelous" and threatened a lawsuit: "The essence of a libel claim, of course, is the protection of oneâ€™s reputation," Timesâ€™ lawyer David McCraw wrote. â€œMr. Trump has bragged about his non-consensual sexual touching of women. He has bragged about intruding on beauty pageant contestants in their dressing rooms. He acquiesced to a radio hostsâ€™ request to discuss Mr. Trumpâ€™s own daughter as a â€piece of ass.â€™ Multiple women not mentioned in our article have publicly come forward to report on Mr. Trumpâ€™s unwanted advances. Nothing in our article has the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself.â€

-- Melania Trump's lawyers also threatened to sue People magazine over the first-person account written by Trump accuser Natasha Stoynoff, demanding a retraction and saying that portions of the story are "completely fictionalized."

-- People editor-in-chief Jess Cagle posted a lengthy defense of Stoynoff and the story: â€œMs. Stoynoff is a remarkable, ethical, honest and patriotic woman. We stand steadfastly by her, and are proud to publish her clear, credible account of what happened."

-- Clinton allies David Brock and Gloria Allred both offered to help cover legal fees for and otherwise represent Trumpâ€™s accusers: "We would pay for the legal defense of Trump accusers,â€ said Brock, a Democratic operative. And Allred, a civil rights lawyer, also signaled openness: â€œIf any women who are making allegations of inappropriate [conduct] contact me, I would be happy to speak to them and then decide if I would be able to represent them,â€ she said. (Politico)

-- Donald Trump Jr. defended his father. Asked about the two women who talked with the Times, he said during a radio interview: "Come on guys, it's so ridiculous, I've never heard anything dumber in my life. ... I think it makes him a human. I think it makes him a normal person, not a political robot.â€ (CNN)

-- In another radio interview, from 2013, Don Jr. actually suggested that women who cannot tolerate harassment â€œdonâ€™t belong in the workforceâ€: â€œIf you canâ€™t handle some of the basic stuff thatâ€™s become a problem in the workforce today, then you donâ€™t belong in the workforce,â€ the younger Trump  said. â€œLike, you should go maybe teach kindergarten. I think itâ€™s a respectable position.â€ The hosts then joked about hypothetically pulling up pictures of naked women on their computer screens. â€œIâ€™d feel harassed!â€ Trump, Jr. joked. â€œThis is my get rich quick scheme. Iâ€™m now suing you guys because I feel uncomfortable. And by the way, thatâ€™s what happens in the world. I can play along, I can be fine, and then I can decide randomly â€” â€uh oh, you now have crossed the line, even though Iâ€™ve been going with it.â€™â€ (Buzzfeed)

-- Ivanka Trump, stumping for her father in the Philadelphia suburbs, avoided any talk of the groping allegations. â€œIvanka, perpetually on point, stayed on message,â€ NBCâ€™s Leigh Ann Caldwell reports. â€œSo much so that some of the same questions were repeated in each of the events, including what it was like to work with her dad and brothers, what she likes about Pennsylvania and why she thinks her dad would be a good president.â€

-- Why didnâ€™t Trumpâ€™s people see any of this coming? Because the candidate rebuffed political aidesâ€™ requests to provide standard-fare opposition research that is traditional for any public figure -- and the decision ultimately contributed to his campaign being caught off guard this week. Both Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort made these requests when they took the reins of Trumpâ€™s campaign, and it became a point of contention among his top political advisers. (Bloombergâ€™s Kevin Cirilli)

-- A review of previously-sealed New York records shows that neither Trump nor the Trump Foundation actually gave the $10,000 that they pledged to a 9/11 charity organization in the months following the attack. From the New York Daily News: The review, conducted by city comptroller Scott Stringer, â€œappears to contradict Trump's prior boasts of spontaneous generosity, made as his hometown reeled from the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil in history â€¦ The records show that through mid-2002 there is no evidence that Trump personally or through the Trump Foundation gave to either group. The only recorded major donation to 9/11 causes that Trump has made was $100,000 from his foundation â€” which has been bankrolled by others without any money from Trump for years â€” to the 9/11 Museum in April 2016, as he sought to generate headlines after Cruz attacked him for his â€New York valuesâ€™ during the primary election.â€

-- Ten former nuclear launch control officers signed an open letter saying that Trump â€œshould not have his finger on the button.â€ The letter says the decision to use nuclear weapons requires â€œcomposure, judgment, restraint and diplomatic skillâ€ â€” all qualities that the former Air Force officers who signed it said Trump lacks. (Carol Morello)

-- A group of former Reagan administration alumni have formed a group called â€œReaganites Opposing Trump.â€ In a post on Medium, former George W. Bush National Intelligence Director John D. Negroponte writes: â€œRonald Reagan was a man of wisdom, humor, unfailing courtesy and measured temperament. I personally observed these traits â€¦ during daily meetings in the Oval Office, meetings with foreign leaders and in the Situation Room. He would have been appalled by Donald Trumpâ€™s utterances and behavior. Mr. Trump has no claim whatsoever to the mantle of Ronald Reagan.â€

-- â€œWhat happened to â€Americaâ€™s Mayorâ€™? How Rudy Giuliani became Trumpâ€™s attack dog,â€ by Paul Schwartzman and Ben Terris: â€œA year ago, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani read an editorial in his hometown newspaper mocking him as a â€shillâ€™ for endorsing a little-known Republican [district attorney candidate].  Angry, Giuliani phoned the editorial page editor, Arthur Browne, to defend his endorsement. But the point that appeared to wound Giuliani the most, Browne recalled, was the editorialâ€™s assertion that the former mayor â€resides today beyond political relevance.â€™ â€œâ€™I am relevant,â€™ [he insisted], â€because all these people want my endorsement.â€™  The former mayor has no such worries these days. Eight years after his own presidential bid failed, Giuliani has emerged as Trumpâ€™s unflinching chief apologist, cheerleader and rhetorical Rottweiler â€¦ Itâ€™s a role that confounds allies and admirers who remember Giulianiâ€™s rise as a law-and-order Republican twice elected in the countryâ€™s largest bastion of liberalism. â€From his days as U.S. attorney, he was at the top of the organizational chart,â€™ [a] former adviser said. â€œNow heâ€™s staff. He carries bags. He walks behind Trump. Itâ€™s just amazing to see.â€™â€

-- Clinton submitted formal answers under penalty of perjury over her use of a private email server at the State Department, declaring 20 times that she did not recall requested information and discussions, and asserting she was never warned that the practice could run afoul of laws on preserving federal records. From Politicoâ€™s Josh Gerstein: "Clinton also said she could not recall ever being warned about any hacking or attempted hacking of her private account or server. Clinton's answers ge
