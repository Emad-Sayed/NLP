Empty bleachers and a hostile student body greeted Trump vice presidential nominee Mike Pence in Virginia on Saturday at one of the most religiously conservative schools in the country.

Trumpâ€™s VP nominee railed against Hillary Clinton in Northern Virginia on Saturday afternoonâ€”but he chose to do it at an evangelical Christian college with a history of anti-Trump sentiment. Students protested outside, while inside students stood in silent protest until they were ejected mid-speech.

The protests and poor attendance at the speech at Patrick Henry College illustrate the challenges that Trump has appealing to evangelical Christians, especially younger ones, who are turned off by his tone, his campaign ideas and his personal historyâ€”and are not at all assauged by his choice of Pence for his running mate.

â€œThe PHC student body as a whole is very anti-Trump. A lot of them say, â€I donâ€™t like him but Iâ€™m going to turn up my nose and vote for him because I like Hillary even less.â€™ But overall there is a severe disgust with Trump,â€ said Sebastian Lopez, a junior studying political theory at the school who was protesting the speech, holding a sign for hours outside in the blazing mid-day sun.

â€œI donâ€™t think that Mike Pence is a bad person, but I think he has made an alliance with someone who is completely unacceptable from a libertarian, conservative or progressive standpoint,â€ added Christian McGuire, a junior at Patrick Henry College studying American politics who was also demonstrating against Pence.

Penceâ€™s visit is not the first misstep by the Trump campaign in Virginia. Donald Trump flubbed his speech in Northern Virginia earlier this month when he lectured the affluent locals in the audience as if they were the Rust Beltâ€”â€œYouâ€™re doing lousy over here,â€ he remarkedâ€”and then listed factory closures in far-flung areas of the state that were hours away, as well as a plant that closed in North Carolina.

Patrick Henry College is located in Loudoun County, the affluent swing district an hour from Washington, D.C., that voted for Bush twice, and then Obama twice. Itâ€™s as close to a must-win county as it gets.

But locals werenâ€™t interested in hearing what he had to say. When Marco Rubio visited in February during the Republican primaries, students and local residents crammed into the room, filling the bleachers, the gymnasium floor and the balconies above to get a glimpse of the presidential candidate. The road outside the college was jam-packed. Parking was a nightmare.

â€œThere are certainly students who support Trump, though most are not enthusiastic. He was rarely the first choice in such a crowded primary field,â€ said Tim Kocher, a spokesman for the Patrick Henry College Republicans. â€œI believe Trump has a solid base of support around 15-20%, but many students simply have not made up their minds as far as the presidential race goes.â€

When Pence visited Saturday, the room was half-emptyâ€”a whole set of retractable bleachers sat empty and discarded near the stage; no admiring crowds leaned over the balcony to get a better look at the politician; parking was a breeze. This lackluster turnout took place at a school which in fall 2015 registered just 294 students, yet had about as many White House interns during the Bush administration as Georgetown University, with its nearly 18,000 students.

â€œIâ€™m a B-list Republican celebrity,â€ Pence said self-deprecatingly, as he thanked attendees for showing up on a beautiful, cloudless Saturday afternoon. It was funny because it was kind of sad, and it was sad because it was kind of true.

Pence also spoke as if he did not quite understand whose ticket he was on. â€œWe believe in free trade,â€ he said, as if Trump had not run a campaign slamming international trade. The governor also slammed Hillary Clintonâ€™s plan to tax the rich, as if the Republican nominee had not taken aim at Wall Street during his populist run for the White House. Americans are â€œtired of politicians who divide our country to unite their support,â€ he said, as if Trump had not run a campaign that regularly disparaged Muslims, foreigners and women.

As if to bolster this point, a group of protesters critical of Trumpâ€™s rhetoric on Islam revealed their T-shirts during Penceâ€™s speech, engaging in a silent protest of the Republican ticket as they were slowly escorted out.

Even the students who supported the Trump-Pence ticket seemed to be doing so with an air of resignation, buoyed only by the threat they believe Hillary Clinton poses to the country.
