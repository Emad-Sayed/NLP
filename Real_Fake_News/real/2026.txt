While some on the Right want to downplay the race angle, others on the Left suggest that the entire success of the modern GOP was premised on exploiting Southern racism. Interestingly, though, much of what both sides think we know about this trend appears to be wrong. Elections analyst Sean Trende recently argued that â€œwhile the dominant narrative continues to insist that the South began to realign toward the Republicans in the wake of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in fact, Southern loyalties had begun to weaken during the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt.â€ As evidence, Trende notes that the South voted increasingly Republican every year of FDRâ€™s presidency, and that although Eisenhower lost Dixie, he did so by only three points. What is more, while Eisenhower was gaining support in the South, he was simultaneously pushing civil rights legislation. So why did the South become increasingly Republican starting in the 1940s? According to Trende, â€œSouthern whites simply became wealthy enough to start voting Republican.â€ This, of course, flies in the face of everything we think we know about why the South became solidly Republican. This is not to suggest that race wasnâ€™t involved in the shift that really began to reach a tipping point after the â€™60s, but it does suggest that history is more complex than the Readerâ€™s Digest (or, rather, the Mother Jones) version many of us are taught in school.

After the postâ€”Civil Rights Act â€œDixiecratâ€ shift, economics and airâ€‘conditioning conspired to send American voters fleeing the Rust Belt for the Sun Belt, further eroding the power of the Northeast Republican establishment, personified by the New York governors and presidential aspirants Thomas Dewey and Nelson Rockefeller. (This is a trend that is still under way; according to the U.S. census, the city of Austin, Texasâ€”the liberal enclave in a deeply red stateâ€”was, by far, the fastest growing city in America from 2010 to 2013.) Itâ€™s unwise to write off an entire swath of the nation, but thatâ€™s just what Barry Goldwater, who represented Arizona in the U.S. Senate, seemed to do when he declared that â€œsometimes I think the country would be better off if we could just saw off the Eastern seaboard and let it float out to sea.â€ The Johnson campaign turned that line into a devastating ad in which the eastern side of a U.S. map, floating in water, is literally sawed off.

Truth be told, the Southâ€™s influence came to dominate both parties. Democrats soon saw that the only way they could win would be to cut into the GOPâ€™s base. For a while, it looked like the only path to Democratic victory was through nominating a son of the South. From Texan Lyndon Johnson to Georgia peanut farmer Jimmy Carter to Arkansasâ€™s Bill Clinton (and even to, yes, Al Gore), seemingly only Southern Democrats could win the White Houseâ€”and even that trend was not very recent; consider Virginiaâ€‘born segregationist Woodrow Wilson or Harry Truman, the descendants of slaveholders and Confederate sympathizers, or even Warm Springs, Georgia, resident FDR. In the postâ€‘Reagan years, Southerners so dominated both parties that at one point, we had a president from Arkansas (Clinton), a vice president from Tennessee (Gore), a Majority Leader from Mississippi (Trent Lott), and a House Speaker from Georgia (Newt Gingrich). The chairman of the GOP was Haley Barbour, from Mississippi. President George W. Bush of Texas, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee, and House Majority Leaders Dick Armey and Tom DeLay (Texans) soon followed in what was, perhaps, the apex of Southern domination of the GOP, and simultaneously, of Republican triumphalism. Talk circulated that the GOP had achieved a â€œpermanent governing majority.â€

Ronald Reagan downplayed his intellectual and cosmopolitan credentials to accentuate his everyman persona. In similar fashion, Dwight Eisenhower, the former supreme commander of Allied forces in Europe and president of Columbia University, dodged questions by employing bumbling answers at press conferences. â€œIn public he wore a costume of affability, optimism, and farmâ€‘boy charm,â€ wrote David Brooks in The Road to Character. â€œAs president, he was perfectly willing to appear stupider than he really was if it would help him perform his assigned role. He was willing to appear tongueâ€‘tied if it would help him conceal his true designs.â€ Biographer Andrew Sinclair said much the same thing about the muchâ€‘maligned Warren Hardingâ€™s â€œmute your own hornâ€ leadership style. In this regard, George W. Bush simply followed a longâ€‘standing traditionâ€”albeit with a Texas twang. Tevi Troy, the former Bush aide who authored What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted, believes that â€œBush probably read more history than [Jack] Kennedy.â€ If that sounds absurd, itâ€™s partly because Kennedy highlighted his intellectual credentials, while the Yaleâ€‘educated Bush downplayed his. As a result, we consider Kennedy (no dummy, but no genius, either) smarter. Is this only the result of a liberal media painting Republicans as illiterate Babbitts? Hardly. â€œTo be fair,â€ Troy writes, â€œBush was not blameless in acquiring a reputation for not reading.â€

In 2000, the New York Timesâ€™ Nicholas Kristoff wrote that Kent Hance believes he â€œhelped teach Mr. Bush the need to be more folksy.â€ As Mr. Hance put it, â€œHe wasnâ€™t going to be outâ€‘Christianed or outâ€‘goodâ€‘oldâ€‘boyed again.â€ If this is true (and one suspects it is), then itâ€™s hard to fault Bush for doing what he had to do to win. And letâ€™s not forget that he wasnâ€™t just trying to forge his own comeback; he was also attempting to avenge his fatherâ€™s defeat at the hands of Bill Clinton in 1992. What is more, his father, former President George H. W. Bush, had been mocked as a taxâ€‘raiser and a preppy wimp. George W. Bush did everything possible to be the opposite of that. The adoption of the Texas persona helped, but the younger Bush overswaggered and overtwanged. But hey, he managed to win two elections, and winning is everything, right?

The problem was, although this is a bipartisan phenomenon, it just happens to have disproportionately impacted the Right. Again, Republicans are thought of as the stupid party. Both sides of the political aisle occasionally genuflect at the altar of rural superiority, even if Republicans are decidedly better at it. Although President Obamaâ€™s appeal to urbanites and minorities is obvious, he is not above the affectation of droppinâ€™ his gs and prattlinâ€™ on about â€œfolks.â€ Likewise, prep schoolâ€”bred John Kerry (â€œCan I get me a hunting license here?â€) experimented with some downright, downâ€‘home Forrest Gump elocution during his 2004 race. Hillary Clinton has been known to affect a Southern accent when convenient. Even less subtle was the overâ€‘theâ€‘top, twangy country music song â€œStand With Hillaryâ€ released in late 2014â€”â€œPut your boots on and letâ€™s smash this ceilinâ€™ â€â€”where all the gs were dropped. The producer of the â€œStand With Hillaryâ€ song also produced a 2008 viral mariachi video, â€œViva Obama.â€ Nothing happens by accident in politics. Hillaryâ€™s pandering is a transparent attempt to woo the â€œreal America.â€ Noting the dichotomy between Obamaâ€™s popâ€‘culture outreachâ€”which featured the Will.I.Am song â€œYes We Canâ€ and Hillaryâ€™sâ€”Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist website, observed, â€œThe attempt to pander to the white working class voters left out by the Democratic agenda for so many years is obvious and clumsy, but also revealing, signaling their perception of whatâ€™s happened to the electorate in the course of the Obama era.â€

For all the GOPâ€™s problems, it is perhaps instructive to remember that Democrats also face their own challenges, which include struggles to win white votesâ€”and their own gender gap with men. Putting aside politics, the notion that America should have one de facto white party and one de facto minority party strikes me as unhealthy. We should all resist this sort of racial balkanization. And, of course, just as Republicans confront regional geographic problems, the Democrats missed winning the White House in 2000, at least partly because Al Gore couldnâ€™t deliver his home state of Tennessee. Just a dozen years ago, former senator Zell Miller, a conservative Democrat, penned a book titled A National Party No More, lamenting the fact that his beloved party had written off the South, and would continue to pay an electoral price. â€œToday, our national Democratic leaders look south and say, â€I see oneâ€‘third of a nation and it can go to hell,â€™ â€ he wrote. This is a good example of how political fortunes can quickly change. Just as Millerâ€™s book hasnâ€™t aged well (electorally speaking, the Democrats seem to have made the right political moves), a dozen years from now this book might seem antiquated. I wonâ€™t be at all upset if that happens. Still, almost all the longâ€‘term trends (including demographic shifts and shifts in public opinion) seem to suggest the GOP is in trouble if it doesnâ€™t adapt and overcome.

In the introduction of this book, I wrote about my rural background in western Maryland and the deep abiding respect I have for rural Americans who have done much to make this a great country. I donâ€™t want to see an America where everyone is huddled into cities. In the words of Hank Williams Jr., we need Americans who still know how to â€œskin a buckâ€ and â€œrun a trotline.â€ But one of the many challenges confronting conservatives is that America has transitioned from the agrarian age to the industrial age to the information age. Unlike the industrial age, where the topâ€‘down assembly line model favored liberals, the tech revolution may favor the rugged individualism embraced by libertarianâ€‘leaning conservatives. Regardless, given these trends, it makes little sense for a movement or a party to allow the ruralâ€‘versusâ€‘urban paradigmâ€”and the many cultural issues tied up in thatâ€”to define and assign membership status. So long as Republicans could win this way, it made perfect sense to exploit the cleavage between city folks and â€œReal America.â€ Not only was this smart politics, but it also tapped into deepâ€‘seated beliefs.

So where did this traditional deification of rural areas come from? Among other things, credit (or blame) the influence of religion (think the Garden of Eden versus the Tower of Babel), philosophy (Rousseauâ€™s notion about noble savages, and later, transcendentalists like Ralph Waldo Emersonâ€”and Walden Woods-loving Henry David Thoreau), and various ideas conceived during the time of Americaâ€™s founding, such as Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s agrarianism. â€œI think our governments will remain virtuous for many centuries,â€ Jefferson wrote Madison, â€œas long as they are chiefly agricultural; and this will be as long as there shall be vacant lands in any part of America. When they get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, they will become corrupt as in Europe.â€ This was bipartisan. Believe it or not, in the runâ€‘up to his 1932 election, Grotonâ€‘ and Harvardâ€‘educated Franklin Roosevelt enjoyed far more support from rural and Southern voters than with bigâ€‘city typesâ€”and painted himself not as a former Wall Street lawyer but rather as a simple â€œfarmer.â€

This brings us to a contradiction within conservatism. Much of conservatismâ€”a belief in free markets, for instanceâ€”is premised on the dynamic notion that more people equal more ideas. But while optimistic free marketeers adhering to this Reagan and Kemp model subscribe to this theory, most populists do not. The more optimistic worldview made major strides when economists like Julian Simon and Ester Boserup took on the Malthusian catastrophe argument, which erroneously predicted that global overpopulation would lead to mass starvation, and demonstrated that more people equals more ideas, innovation, and prosperity. When you think about it, it makes sense. Rural societies tend to work on subsistence (you eat what you growâ€” be careful what you wish for, â€œlocal foodsâ€ advocates!), but cities, by their very nature, demand free market economic skills such as cooperation, specialization, and trade. These things make us rich. And cities are the areas where these things are appreciated and magnified. And let us not forget that great cities, after all, not only have fostered great hedge funds, but have also built great cathedrals stone by stone.

Leaders emerge during times of tragedy and crisis, and it was at this moment that Nikki Haley, the female, Indian American governor of South Carolina, who also happens to be a conservative Republican, seized the moment. â€œToday we are here in a moment of unity in our state without ill will to say it is time to remove the flag from our capitol grounds,â€ Haley said at a press conference on June 22, 2015. â€œThis flag, while an integral part of our past, does not represent the future of our great state.â€ She was flanked by Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, who is one of only two African Americans in the U.S. Senate. And, in a way, the South Carolina governor and these senators represent a changing Republican Party, as well as a changing South. Graham, the only white representative, is probably the least conservative of the three. But they bring diverse perspectives that not very long ago were absent from Republican politics in the South. â€œThe biggest reason I asked for that flag to come down was I couldnâ€™t look my children in the face and justify it staying there,â€ Haley later told CNNâ€™s Don Lemon. â€œWhat I realized now more than ever is people were driving by and they felt hurt and pain. No one should feel pain â€¦ My father wears a turban. My mother, at the time, wore a sari. It was hard growing up in South Carolina.â€
