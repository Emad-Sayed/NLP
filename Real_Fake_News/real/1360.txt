â€œYou know, they donâ€™t use waterboarding over there; they use chopping off peopleâ€™s heads,â€ Trump said Sunday on ABCâ€™s â€œThis Week with George Stephanopoulos.â€ Waterboarding, a method of torture in which water is poured over the face of an immobilized prisoner to simulate drowning, is â€œpeanutsâ€ compared with that, Trump said. He said he â€œwould absolutely bring back interrogation and strong interrogation.â€

Ben Carson, running 4 percentage points behind Trump in the latest Bloomberg Politics national poll, taken Nov. 15-17, declined to say whether heâ€™d favor waterboarding, during an appearance on the same program.

â€œIâ€™m not one who is real big on telling the enemy what weâ€™re going to do and what weâ€™re not going to do,â€ Carson said.

Trump seemed to moderate earlier comments that were taken as support for a U.S. government registry of Muslims, saying he wants a database for refugees coming into the country from Syria.

â€œWhen the Syrian refugees are going to start pouring into this country, we donâ€™t know if theyâ€™re ISIS, we donâ€™t know if itâ€™s a Trojan horse,â€ Trump said. â€œAnd I definitely want a database and other checks and balances.â€

The billionaire New York real-estate developer also argued for a program to monitor activity at U.S. mosques.

â€œI donâ€™t want to close mosques; I want to surveil mosques,â€ he said. Without what he called â€œstrong measures,â€ he warned that â€œyouâ€™re going to see buildings coming down all over New York City and elsewhere.â€

Carson, a retired doctor, also agreed with heavy monitoring of those with the most potential of leaning toward terrorism.

â€œWe should monitor anything -- mosques, church, school, you know, shopping center -- where there is a lot of radicalization going on,â€ Carson said, acknowledging that it could require beefing up U.S. intelligence capabilities.

Carson, who has said he favored what he considered a fairly easy measure to undermine the Islamic Stateâ€™s finances by destroying their oil fields, was questioned on that point after President Barack Obama said such methods arenâ€™t so simple according to the â€œbest military minds.â€

â€œWe donâ€™t really have the option of deciding whether itâ€™s easy or not to take them out,â€ Carson said Sunday. â€œWe need to get rid of their ability to derive money from oil, whether we take the fields or whether we blow the fields up.â€

He said Iraqi military forces may perform better if they worked directly with U.S. special operations personnel.

Trump was also questioned Sunday about whether he would favor banning people on terrorist watch lists from obtaining firearms, to which he responded, â€œIf somebody is on a watch list and an enemy of state and we know itâ€™s an enemy of state, I would keep them away, absolutely.â€
