Jeb Bushâ€™s resignation from the presidential race has already set off a chain reaction within the G.O.P., with The Huffington Post reporting Mitt Romney is set to endorse Marco Rubio following his strong second-place finish in Saturdayâ€™s South Carolina primary. And, according to Politico, the pressure is already on for Bush to do the same.

Though details of Romneyâ€™s endorsement are â€œstill being worked outâ€ as of this morning, sources tell The Huffington Post that Romney has been â€œeager to provide his backing to Rubio for daysâ€ but hesitated out of respect for Bush. His endorsement could come before Tuesdayâ€™s G.O.P. caucuses in Nevada, which dedicated Romneyists will recall were twice won by Romney himself.

For his part, though, Rubio doesnâ€™t believe the Romney endorsement is coming anytime soon. â€œWell, that report is false,â€ he told CNN of the Romney rumors on Sunday. â€œI have no reason to believe that heâ€™s anywhere near endorsing anyone. We would love to have his endorsement, but thereâ€™s nothing forthcoming. I donâ€™t know where those reports are coming from, but theyâ€™re false.â€

Should Romney indeed endorse Rubio, his backing would make sense, as he and Rubio have a history: Rubio once made Romneyâ€™s VP shortlist, and Rubio once chilled at Romneyâ€™s New Hampshire vacation home on the Fourth of July, which is the most Republican sentence that has ever been written. Romneyâ€™s seal of approval is key in that it suggests establishment Republican leaders are finally ready to â€œcoalesceâ€ around Rubio, rallying together to defeat the waking nightmare that is Donald Trumpâ€™s current front-running status.

On the Jeb-endorsing-Rubio front, things are less clear-cut. The two fellow Floridians spent months savaging each other on the campaign trail, and Bush dropped out of the race because Rubio essentially destroyed him in South Carolina. Bush needs a few days to cool off, call his mom, and secure his invite to Romneyâ€™s New Hampshire vacation home before heâ€™s ready to address the Florida politicos who are chomping at the bit to know whether heâ€™ll â€œendorse the man he long called a friendâ€ in public but apparently lambastes in privateâ€”sometimes in â€œstrikingly personal overtones,â€ according to Politico. If Bush decides not to endorse Rubio, it will mark a significant political rift in Floridaâ€”a state where, it should be mentioned, Trump remains far ahead in the polls.

The clock is ticking for both possible endorsements: Floridians are already voting by absentee ballot for the March 15 primary, which means somebody needs to tell them who the hell to vote for before itâ€™s too late and Trump wins the nomination. â€œNo one knows whatâ€™s going to happen,â€ an anonymous Florida House Republican told Politico. â€œThere are a lot of hard feelings. Weâ€™ll have to wait till the dust settles. Make that, the dirt. Once the dirt settles.â€
