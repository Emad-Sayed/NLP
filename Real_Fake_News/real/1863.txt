Hillary Clinton sought to minimize new disclosures that top secret  government information passed through the private email server she used when she was secretary of state, dismissing the controversy as an â€œinter-agency disputeâ€ that  pales next to the larger issues on the minds of voters.

In an interview with NBC News on Saturday morning, two days before the Iowa caucuses, Mrs. Clinton said, â€œItâ€™s the same story thatâ€™s been going on for months now. And I just donâ€™t think most people are as concerned about that as they are about what weâ€™re going to do to get the economy going.â€
