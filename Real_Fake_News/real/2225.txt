NOT ON THE SHORT LIST

Former Vice President Dick Cheney may hate Donald Trump, but heâ€™s fine with him leading the country.

Cheney reportedly told CNN on Friday he intends to support the GOP nominee in 2016, just as he has every prior cycle.

Shortly after the first presidential debate, Cheney told Fox Newsâ€™ Bret Baier that the real estate mogulâ€™s assertions regarding the September 11 attacksâ€”including that George W. Bush willingly let them happenâ€”were â€œway off base.â€

â€œHe clearly doesnâ€™t understand or has not spent any time learning about the facts of that period,â€ Cheney said.

Itâ€™s a little curious that Cheney has decided to board the Trump Train. Itâ€™s also a break from the rest of Bush World, as representatives for George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush say neither former president will back the mogulâ€™s presidential bid.

In 2011, Trump made a YouTube video for his â€œFrom The Desk of Donald Trumpâ€ series, (a series I cannot recommend highly enough), in which the presumptive nominee trashed the former VP and his then-newly released memoir.

â€œHeâ€™s very, very angry and nasty,â€ the mogul said. â€œI didnâ€™t like Cheney when he was a vice president. I donâ€™t like him now. And I donâ€™t like people that rat out everybody like heâ€™s doing in the book. Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll be a best-seller, but isnâ€™t it a shame? Hereâ€™s a guy that did a rotten job as vice president. Nobody liked him. Tremendous divisiveness. And heâ€™s gonna be making a lot of money on the book. I wonâ€™t be reading it.â€

â€œIt just seemed like she was going to really look to impeach Bush and get him out of office, which, personally, I think would have been a wonderful thing,â€ he said, discussing Nancy Pelosi with Wolf Blitzer on The Situation Room.

â€œHe got us into the war with lies,â€ he continued. â€œAnd, I mean, look at the trouble Bill Clinton got into with something that was totally unimportant. And they tried to impeach him, which was nonsense. And, yet, Bush got us into this horrible war with lies, by lying, by saying they had weapons of mass destruction, by saying all sorts of things that turned out not to be true.â€

â€œReligious freedomâ€™s been a very important part of our history and where we came from,â€ he addedâ€”but if Cheney has anything to do with it, then Trumpâ€™s America is where weâ€™re going.
