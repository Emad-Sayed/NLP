Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Sunday defended his criticism that Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign success is based largely on her being a female candidate and dismissed assertions about him having a soft foreign policy.

â€œThe only card she has is the woman card,â€ Trump told â€œFox News Sunday.â€ â€œEven women donâ€™t like her. If she were not a woman, she would not even be in this race.â€

The billionaire businessman resumed his Clinton attack following

 his sweep in five Northeast primary contests, saying Tuesday that â€œthe only card she has is the woman's card. And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote.â€



The front-running Trump also dismissed criticism that he sounded like a liberal Democrat in his foreign policy speech last week by suggesting the United States scale back in the Middle East and focus on domestic spending.

â€œWe need to knock off ISIS and get out of there,â€ said Trump, who nevertheless continues to argue that overthrowing dictators has been a failed foreign policy strategy that has led to instability in the Middle East.

â€œEvery move we've made in the Middle East has been wrong,â€ he said, arguing other countries should pay more to protect the world and that more taxpayer money must go to U.S. infrastructure.â€

â€œWe canâ€™t have this anymore,â€ he said. â€œWe are spending all of our money in the Middle East. We need to strengthen our military and pull back â€¦ In the meantime our country is becoming Third World. â€¦ I will be tougher thanâ€ Clinton.

GOP primary rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€ that Trump's policy speech â€œreflects a weak and naive approach to foreign policy.â€

Trump also argued that his attacks on Clinton are no worse than those of her primary challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has questioned the former secretary of stateâ€™s qualifications.

While both Clinton and Trumpâ€™s favorability ratings among women are low, Trumpâ€™s are worse, especially among female general election voters.

However, Trump argued Sunday that his numbers will improve if and when he faces Clinton in the general election.

â€œOnce I start on Hillary, the numbers will change,â€ he said. â€œWatch what happens with Hillary. Watch what happens with her numbers.â€
