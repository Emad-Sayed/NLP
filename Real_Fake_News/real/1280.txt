Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed sharply Thursday over who is more progressive, at a debate that saw the former secretary of state ratcheting up her criticism of the Vermont senator on several fronts â€“ even accusing him of engineering an â€œartful smearâ€ with suggestions she could be â€œboughtâ€ by donors.

The debate, the first since the Iowa caucuses and last before next weekâ€™s critical New Hampshire primary, was by far the most confrontational of the Democratic primary race.

Clinton, coming off a narrow Iowa win and trying to shrink Sandersâ€™ huge lead in Granite State polls, stayed on offense for most of the night. She slammed Sandersâ€™ campaign promises as too costly, while standing firm in claiming sheâ€™s a true â€œprogressiveâ€ despite Sandersâ€™ comments to the contrary.

Sanders, meanwhile, dug in as he questioned whether Clinton really â€œwalks the walkâ€ of the progressive cause â€“ and described her as the candidate of the â€œestablishment.â€

â€œSecretary Clinton does represent the establishment. I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans,â€ he said, stressing that he, unlike Clinton, doesnâ€™t enjoy super PAC backing and is funded in large part by small-dollar donations.

The verbal jabs flew quickly, and Clinton left few allegations unchallenged, visibly fed up with a campaign trail narrative that has painted her as the candidate of Wall Street. She rebutted Sandersâ€™ â€œestablishmentâ€ charge by questioning whether someone running to be the first female president can carry that label.

The most heated moment at the MSNBC-hosted debate in Durham, N.H., came when Clinton told Sanders she rejects the suggestion that anyone who takes donations or speaking fees from interest groups can be bought.

â€œEnough is enough,â€ Clinton said, telling Sanders the â€œattacks by insinuationâ€ are not â€œworthyâ€ of him. Clinton said if Sanders has something to allege, â€œsay it directly,â€ but: â€œYou will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.â€

She closed: â€œI think itâ€™s time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeks.â€

That line earned a groan from Sanders and some boos from the audience.

Sanders went on to link Wall Street deregulation with billions spent on lobbying and campaign contributions.

â€œSome people think, yeah, that had some influence,â€ he said.

Clinton, meanwhile, described herself as a â€œprogressive who gets things done,â€ and ripped Sanders for suggesting Clinton cannot be a â€œmoderateâ€ and a â€œprogressiveâ€ at the same time. She teased Sanders as being the â€œself-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivismâ€ and said she doesnâ€™t know anyone who fits his definition.

The fireworks underscored the tight state of the race going into New Hampshireâ€™s contest next Tuesday. Clinton arrived on the debate stage clearly ready to rebut Sandersâ€™ proposals and accusations â€“ notably his oft-repeated criticism that she, as senator, erred by voting to authorize the use of force in Iraq.

â€œA vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS,â€ she countered.

Yet as Clinton stressed her secretary of state experience and Sanders said that factor is â€œnot arguable,â€ the Vermont senator noted experience is not the only point.

â€œJudgment is,â€ he said, again pointing to the 2002 Iraq vote. â€œOne of us voted the right way, and one of us didnâ€™t.â€

As she has at prior debates, Clinton also challenged the senatorâ€™s proposals for free college and universal health care. â€œThe numbers just donâ€™t add up,â€ Clinton said.

She questioned how the country could, for instance, pay for free tuition at public colleges, as Sanders wants, and accused him of wanting to effectively scrap ObamaCare â€“ a charge he denied.

Sanders defended his plans, particularly for universal health care.

â€œI do believe we should have health care for all,â€ he said.

The former secretary of state met the Vermont senator on stage in Durham, N.H., after eking out a narrow victory in Mondayâ€™s caucuses. While her campaign celebrated the win, Sandersâ€™ strong showing in the state nevertheless has helped boost his fundraising â€“ and he heads into New Hampshire with a steady double-digit lead in the polls.

There remains an ongoing dispute, however, over the Iowa results. The Des Moines Register editorial board earlier Thursday called for an audit of the Democratic caucus results, citing problems and confusion at polling sites.

Asked at Thursdayâ€™s debate about the editorial, Sanders said, â€œI agree with the Des Moines Register.â€

He said after speaking with precinct captains, the campaign believes they may have â€œat least two more delegates.â€

Yet Sanders, who has complained how some local delegates were allocated based on coin tosses, also said they should not â€œblow this out of proportion. â€œ

â€œThis is not the biggest deal in the world,â€ Sanders said.

Asked if sheâ€™d participate in an audit, Clinton said, â€œWhatever they decide to do, thatâ€™s fine.â€

Clinton, separately, said she's "100 percent confident" nothing will come of the FBI probe into her personal email use as secretary of state.

The Democratic debate on Thursday was the first to feature Clinton and Sanders one-on-one, with former Maryland Gov. Martin Oâ€™Malley now out of the race following his distant third showing in Iowa.

The debate was one of four added to the calendar earlier this week, after the Democratic National Committee and the two campaigns agreed to the terms.  The party had come under criticism for its sparse schedule, and was accused of trying to shield Clinton from debates.
