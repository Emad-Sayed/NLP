Hillary Clinton on Thursday derided Donald Trumpâ€™s praise of Vladimir Putin as â€œunpatrioticâ€ and â€œscaryâ€ and suggested the Republican nomineeâ€™s coziness with the Russian president could represent a threat to national security.

In a press conference at an airport in Westchester, New York, her first such formal event in 278 days, Clinton discussed Trumpâ€™s remarks at a â€œcommander-in-chief forumâ€ hosted by NBC and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America in New York on Wednesday night, in which the nominees drew sharp contrasts on foreign policy and national security in back-to-back appearances that previewed their first debate later this month.

â€œBizarrely, once again he praised Russiaâ€™s strongman Vladimir Putin â€“ even taking the astonishing step of suggesting that he prefers the Russian president to our American president,â€ Clinton said on the airport tarmac, in front of her campaign plane. â€œNow, that is not just unpatriotic and insulting to the people of our country as well as to our commander-in-chief â€“ it is scary.â€



On Wednesday night, Trump insisted his praise for Putin was deserved because the Russian president has an â€œ82% approval ratingâ€.

â€œI think when he calls me brilliant, Iâ€™ll take the compliment, OK?â€ Trump said.

Trump has exchanged compliments with Putin, though critics have said Russia is meddling in the US election in order to tip the scales in Trumpâ€™s favor. Until recently, Trumpâ€™s campaign was run by Paul Manafort, who previously worked in Ukraine on behalf of a pro-Russia candidate.

Clinton and her campaign have suggested Russia is using cyber-attacks to meddle in the US election, after a hack of the Democratic National Committee led to the resignation of the DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, just before the partyâ€™s convention in Philadelphia in July. Trump has downplayed the severity of the intrusion and even invited â€“ sarcastically, he claimed â€“ Russia to hack Clintonâ€™s own emails.

On Thursday, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, distanced himself from Trumpâ€™s remarks, accusing Putin of conducting state-sponsored cyber-attacks â€œon what appears to be [the US] political systemâ€.

â€œVladimir Putin is an aggressor who does not share our interests,â€ Ryan told reporters at a press conference in Washington. â€œVladimir Putin is violating the sovereignty of neighboring countries. He is acting like an adversary.â€

Ryan, who has endorsed Trump, grew frustrated by questions about the Republican nomineeâ€™s remarks. He did not watch the forum event, he said, and did not wish to respond to every comment Trump makes.

â€œIâ€™m not going to stand up here and do a tit-for-tat on what Donald said last night,â€ Ryan said.

In New York, Clinton also criticized Trumpâ€™s remarks about US generals, who he said had been â€œreduced to rubbleâ€ under the leadership of President Obama, to a degree that is â€œembarrassing for our countryâ€.

â€œWhat would Ronald Reagan say about a Republican nominee who attacks Americaâ€™s generals and heaps praise on Russiaâ€™s president?â€ Clinton said. â€œI think we know the answer.â€

Clinton challenged Republicans to denounce Trumpâ€™s comments. â€œEvery Republican holding or seeking office in this country should be asked if they agree with Donald Trump about these statements,â€ she said.



In the forum, Clinton and Trump diverged on whether the US should deploy ground troops to Iraq. Clinton restated her opposition to sending a contingent of troops into Syria and said she would not deploy ground troops to Iraq â€œever againâ€. Trump disagreed.

â€œWe would leave a certain group behind and they would take the various sections where they have the oil,â€ he said, regarding a policy apparently meant to prevent terror groups such as Islamic State from gaining command of such a vital resource.

On Thursday, Clinton denounced this approach. â€œThe United States of America does not invade other countries to plunder and pillage,â€ she said. â€œWe donâ€™t send our brave men and women around the world to steal oil.

â€œAnd thatâ€™s not even getting into the absurdity of what it would involve â€“ massive infrastructure, large numbers of troops, many years on the ground. Of course, Trump hasnâ€™t thought through any of that.â€

After the press conference, Clinton departed for Charlotte, North Carolina, where she was due to hold a rally on Thursday afternoon.
