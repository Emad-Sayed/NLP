Mitch McConnell has decided to wager the Republican majority in the Senate on blocking Barack Obamaâ€™s pick for the Supreme Court.

Itâ€™s a bold and understandable gambit designed to prevent a leftward lurch in jurisprudence after Antonin Scaliaâ€™s unexpected death this weekend, but it could backfire badly.

Assuming the president picks a Hispanic, African American or Asian American â€“ bonus points if sheâ€™s a woman â€“ this could be exactly what Democrats need to re-activate the Obama coalition that fueled his victories in 2008 and 2012. Even if he does not go with a minority candidate, the cases on the docket will galvanize voters who are traditionally less likely to turn out.

Last night in Las Vegas, for example, Hillary Clinton said it would be nakedly partisan and unconscionable if Republicans donâ€™t give a hearing to the presidentâ€™s nominee. And she emphasized the immigration case that the justices recently agreed to hear. â€œBecause of his passing, there will be most likely a tie, four to four, on important issues that affect so many people in our country,â€ the Democratic front-runner said. â€œAnd the most important is the decision about President Obamaâ€™s actions under DACA and DAPA. If there is no new justice appointed, then as with other cases before the court, the decision that was decided will stay in place. And that was a bad decision.â€

Keep in mind that a quarter of Nevadaâ€™s population is Hispanic. Beyond being a battleground in the presidential race, there is also an open Senate race to succeed Harry Reid. Democrats will nominate a Latina and Republicans will nominate a white guy who is already in Congress.

Or take abortion rights. Marco Rubio is against abortion even in cases of rape and incest. For women, the prospect of Roe v. Wade being overturned just became much more real. â€œWhen Iâ€™m president of the United States, Iâ€™ll nominate someone like Justice Scalia,â€ the Florida senator declared on the Sunday shows.

And environmentalists just this month saw the court put a stay on Obamaâ€™s Clean Power Plan. The next justice will be the swing vote who determines the future of coal in the United States. Though these sorts of cases mean that business interests will pour more money than ever into 2016 races, it could also help Democrats attract crucial suburban women who might lean to the right but worry about global warming.

More broadly, this could also undermine efforts by Senate Republicans to show that they are capable of governing and not just â€œthe party of no.â€ Make no mistake: The upper chamber will grind to a standstill if the GOP follows through on this threat. Democrats who are inclined to work with them promise to stop doing so if Republicans play hardball.

-- Ultimately, though, there is not really anything Democrats can do procedurally to force Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to hold a hearing on Obamaâ€™s nominee. The only lever they have is public pressure.

The most potent pressure points are the seven GOP incumbents who are up for reelection this year in states Obama carried in 2012. New Hampshireâ€™s Kelly Ayotte and Wisconsinâ€™s Ron Johnson publicly came out in favor of obstruction yesterday. The others are holding their cards close to the vest for right now: Ohioâ€™s Rob Portman praised Scalia but would not address the core issue. Spokesmen for Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Pat Toomey declined to comment and Illinoisâ€™ Mark Kirk ignored inquiries, per CNN.

Pay particularly close attention to Portman, who is already vulnerable and could be wiped out if African Americans make up the same percentage of the electorate in 2016 as they did in 2012. They are likelier to vote if they believe he is disrespecting the first black president.

â€œI intend to continue to talk about this until the polls close,â€ former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, the Democratic candidate against Portman, told my colleague Paul Kane yesterday. â€œSenator Portman, who has your allegiance, your country or your party leaders? â€¦ The people have spoken, on two occasions,â€ he added, referring to Obamaâ€™s 2008 and 2012 victories.

-- Conventional wisdom is that whichever party wins the White House in November will control the Senate. Thatâ€™s obviously the primary factor, but weâ€™re not convinced it will be determinative. Democrats need to pick up four seats to win the Senate, and itâ€™s conceivable they could get those from states that Clinton would probably carry even if she loses the Electoral College. In 2014, itâ€™s worth recalling, Democrats lost each of the seven seats they had to defend in states Mitt Romney had carried two years earlier.

And remember that this wonâ€™t be happening in a vacuum: If Obama knows for sure that his pick is not going to get formally considered, he can go with someone who gives his party maximum political leverage to bludgeon these Republican incumbents. Monica Mrquez is the first Latina and first openly gay justice on the Supreme Court in Colorado, which will again be a crucial swing state. Attorney General Loretta Lynch is an African American woman. Lucy Koh is the first Asian American district judge in the Northern District of California. He could also go with someone who was previously confirmed unanimously by the Senate to give additional rhetorical heft to his attacks that Republicans are being hypocrites.

-- Whatâ€™s the Republican political calculus? Blocking judges historically motivates their base â€“ including donors and the U.S. Chamber â€“ more than it does liberals. And they donâ€™t think independents will really care all that much. It will just sound like more Washington noise. McConnell, not a favorite of the grassroots, also needs to keep his own base ginned up. Amidst a presidential primary, it is untenable for Republicans to look like rubber stamps for Obama.

Chris Christie offers a cautionary tale for GOP members. His bubble in New Hampshire was punctured when opponents began attacking him for offering support of Sonia Sotomayor while he was running for governor of New Jersey in 2008. Christie denied making comments he had made. Allies and rivals agree that the Sotomayor hit was a turning point for his campaign. Republicans who fear primary challenges, such as Alabamaâ€™s Richard Shelby, are never going to back any Obama nominee.

Most smart Republicans in D.C. still believe either Trump or Cruz would lose a general election. Their hope is that a Supreme Court vacancy might help galvanize conservative volunteers to go do work for endangered Senate incumbents.

-- To be sure, not every Democrat has a clean nose on this: Harry Reid shortsightedly invoked the nuclear option in 2013, which allows non-Supreme court judges to be approved by a simple majority. This incensed Republicans and only accelerated the upper chamberâ€™s decline to be more like the unruly House.

Lindsey Graham, one of just two current GOP senators who voted to confirm Elena Kagan during Obamaâ€™s first term, tells The Post that Reid poisoned the well by going nuclear. â€œI voted for every Supreme Court justice nominated by Bush and Obama. I believe the Senate should be deferential to qualified picks,â€ the South Carolina senator said. â€œBut I did tell Harry Reid and the president that the consequence of changing the rules in the Senate to pack the court will come back to haunt them.â€

George F. Will also zeroes in on Reidâ€™s use of the nuclear option in his column today, which he describes as â€œinstitutional vandalism.â€ He frames the battle this way: â€œScaliaâ€™s death will enkindle a debate missing from this yearâ€™s presidential campaign, a debate discomfiting for some conservatives: Do they want a passive court that is deferential to legislative majorities and to presidents who claim untrammeled powers deriving from national majorities? Or do they want a court actively engaged in defending libertyâ€™s borders against unjustified encroachments by majorities?â€

-- The big question right now: Will there even be a confirmation hearing?

McConnellâ€™s Saturday night statement declaring that the vacancy should be filled by the next president did not rule out the possibility of a confirmation hearing or floor time to consider whoever the president picks.

That might be the more politically astute play, since Republicans could slow walk the vetting, trickle out negative revelations about the nominee to right-wing media outlets and then ultimately vote to reject the nominee.

Having hearings could give some cover to purple state Republicans to say they are doing their jobs. â€œIf the Republican leadership refuses to even hold a hearing, I think that is going to guarantee they're going to lose control of the Senate," said Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.

Plus, even if Obamaâ€™s pick gets past the Judiciary Committee, they will be hard pressed to get confirmed by the full Senate. Fourteen Republicans would need to come out against Cruzâ€™s promised filibuster. During Obamaâ€™s first term, when Democrats held a near super-majority, only nine Republicans voted for Sotomayor and five voted for Kagan.

Given that the Senate is on a Presidentâ€™s Day recess, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Obama will not rush out an announcement this week. This gives both sides a few days to poll and focus group their options.

A former top adviser to the president says the GOP could have been savvier:

-- Another wildcard: How will the press cover this? One of the mainstream mediaâ€™s problems is a really short attention span. What is unknowable today is whether this vacancy is a two-week story, a two-month story or a 10-month story? Also, is the narrative that Republicans are creating an unprecedented Constitutional crisis? Or is it played as a boring he-said, he-said storyline?

Democrats note that Obama still has the bully pulpit, so he can come up with creative ways to drive news coverage about the GOPâ€™s failure to bring his nominee up for a vote. The party can also use paid media to target the vulnerable Republican incumbents.

-- For both sides, it really is difficult to overstate the stakes: Scalia left an indelible mark on both the court and our country for nearly three decades, and his replacement could do the same. Ironically, if Clinton wins and Democrats retake the Senate after McConnell spends the year taking heat, she will have a mandate to put the most progressive justice imaginable on the bench. And Republicans will have no real grounds to oppose her. For McConnell, right now, thatâ€™s a risk worth taking.

THE BUZZ AT THE CAPITOL: â€œSome hopeful Democrats now see the nomination of a sitting senator as the best chance Obama has to seat another justice on the Supreme Court before leaving office,â€ Juliet Eilperin and Paul Kane report. â€œThere are several Senate Democrats who fit that description, including Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.), Christopher A. Coons (Del.) and Richard J. Durbin (Ill.). But individuals who have spoken with the White House about the nomination process â€¦ said the president is interested in a candidate who is young enough to serve an extended period of time. Only two of those senators â€” Klobuchar, at 55, and Coons, at 52 â€” are younger than 60, the age Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was when she was nominated.â€

â€¦ But we hear that POTUS is more likely to go with someone who has already been confirmed and vetted. â€œAlthough Obama has installed fewer federal appellate judges than either Presidents Clinton or George W. Bush, he has put enough nominees on the bench that Democratic appointees are in the majority on nine of the nationâ€™s 13 circuit courts,â€ Juliet and Paul note. â€œIn that group, the 9th Circuitâ€™s Paul J. Watford, a 48-year-old African American, and Sri Srinivasan, a 48-year-old judge on U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit who would be the first South-Asian American on the Supreme Court, would be the leading contenders. Others include the D.C. Circuitâ€™s Patricia Ann Millett, 52, and Jane L. Kelly, 51, a judge on the 8th Circuit who was confirmed 96 to 0â€ with the support of Grassley.

-- What does the loss of Scalia mean for cases currently on the docket? â€œIn the short term, conservatives could still prevail on many of the cases before the court this term. But the wins could come in the form of tie votes that preserve the status quo rather than provide precedents that will shape the future,â€ writes Robert Barnes, our Supreme Court correspondent.

A big break for public employee unions: â€œAt oral arguments, the court seemed prepared to hand a significant defeat to organized labor and side with a group of California teachers who claim that their free-speech rights are violated when they are forced to pay dues to the stateâ€™s teachers union. The courtâ€™s conservatives â€” Scalia included â€” appeared ready to junk a 40-year-old precedent that allows unions to collect an â€agency feeâ€™ from nonmembers to support collective-bargaining activities for members and nonmembers alike. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, citing that precedent, had ruled for the union. And with the Supreme Courtâ€™s liberals seemingly united in upholding the precedent, a 4-to-4 vote would mean the union victory would stand.â€

The law could be interpreted differently in different regions: â€œFor instance, a Texas law that imposes new restrictions on abortion providers was found constitutional by a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. A 4-to-4 tie would uphold that finding. But a similar law in Wisconsin was struck down and would be unaffected by the courtâ€™s tie in the Texas case.â€

Barnes adds that, if Republican leaders hold firm, it will also affect which cases the justices choose to take up when the next term starts in October. (Read a breakdown of how four cases will likely be impacted here.)

-- Chaos, confusion and conflicting reports in the hours after Scaliaâ€™s death, which happened during a blue quail hunting trip. From Lana Straub, Eva Ruth Moravec, Sari Horwitz and Jerry Markon: After his body was discovered, it took hours for authorities in remote West Texas to find a justice of the peace. â€œWhen they did, she pronounced Scalia dead of natural causes without seeing the body and decided not to order an autopsy. A second justice of the peace, who was called but couldnâ€™t get to Scaliaâ€™s body in time, said she would have ordered an autopsy. â€If it had been me .â€‰.â€‰. I would want to know,â€™ Juanita Bishop, a justice of the peace in Presidio, Tex., told The Washington Post in an interview Sunday.â€

Some details of his final hours at the Cibolo Creek Ranch, a luxury compound less than an hour from the Mexican border, remain opaque: â€œAs late as Sunday afternoon, there were conflicting reports about whether an autopsy would be performed, though officials later said Scaliaâ€™s body was being embalmed and there would be no autopsy. One report, by WFAA-TV in Dallas, said the death certificate would show the cause of the death was a heart attack.â€

-- South Carolina is Ground Zero for the Republican raceâ€”

Ratings: 13.5 million watched the CBS debate on Saturday, surpassing the 13.3 million who watched last weekendâ€™s debate on ABC and the 8 million who watched the Democratic debate in Milwaukee on PBS/CNN. (CNN Money)

Driving the day: Laura and George W. Bush headline a rally for Jeb in North Charleston tonight. â€œIt tacks away from Bushâ€™s months-long insistence that heâ€™s running as â€my own man,â€™ but could be a perfect fit for South Carolina,â€ the Associated Press notes in a curtain-raiser. â€œGeorge H.W. Bush won twice here. In 2000, George W. Bush beat John McCain. Now itâ€™s his brotherâ€™s turn.â€

Kasichâ€™s super PAC circulated a CNN clip from when Jeb said in New Hampshire last May, â€œI think that in Washington during my brother's time Republicans spent too much money. He could have used the veto power. He didn't have line item veto power, but he could have brought budget discipline to Washington, D.C."

Republican leaders are predicting record turnout in Saturdayâ€™s primary: â€œThe electorate here will be about twice as big as Iowa and New Hampshire combined,â€ said state GOP Chairman Matt Moore. â€œA third are very conservative, a third are somewhat; a third are moderate.â€ Heâ€™s quoted in a Charleston Post and Courier story about efforts to â€œrestore South Carolinaâ€™s credibility in picking the eventual nominee.â€ From the piece: â€œGOP voters here chose correctly in all the party races since 1980 until the turnabout in 2012. â€South Carolinians kind of blew it last time voting for Gingrich,â€™ said Clemson professor David Woodard, who thinks the state is Trumpâ€™s to lose. â€Theyâ€™re taking their â€first-in-the-South primaryâ€™ and â€we pick presidentsâ€™ to heart. There is a seriousness here thatâ€™s on display this time.â€™â€

On the Sunday shows, Trump focused on Cruz. "Justice John Roberts gave us Obamacare twice," Trump said on ABC. "He could have ended Obamacare twice. He got there because Ted Cruz pushed him like wild. ... Cruz shouldn't be talking because that was among the worst appointments I've ever seen. We have Obamacare because of Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush and George Bush." Trump also emphasized Cruz's personality: "No endorsements, no support â€” he's a lone wolf. He's going to get nothing done, he's not a leader, he's never employed anybody, never created a job. He's a nasty guy, no matter how you figure it.â€

â€¦ And Cruz focused on Trump: "If Donald Trump becomes president, the Second Amendment will be written out of the Constitution because it is abundantly clear that Donald Trump is not a conservative. He will not invest the capital to confirm a conservative, so the result will be the same whether itâ€™s Hillary, Bernie or Donald," Cruz said. "The Second Amendment will go away." (Elise Viebeck)

Trump changed his explanation for why no one can find proof that he opposed the invasion of Iraq before 2003: â€œI wasnâ€™t a politician so people didnâ€™t write everything I said,â€ he said on â€œMeet the Press.â€ In September, he said there was ample documentation: â€œIâ€™ll give you 25 different stories.â€ BuzzFeed notes that an August 2004 interview with Esquire is the first known instance of his public opposition.

Both candidates courted the African American vote at the same Baptist church in Las Vegas. John Wagner relays an incredibly awkward scene: â€œClinton and her motorcade already had arrived the Victory Missionary Baptist Church, located in an economically struggling neighborhood west of the Vegas Strip, when Sandersâ€™s entourage pulled in with a police escort. Clinton was seated in the first row, on the left side. Sanders took a seat in the first row, on the right side. The candidates did not shake hands or talk.â€

Later, Clinton stepped up her attacks on Sanders over health care in a Vegas suburb: "We both share the goal of universal health-care coverage, but he wants to start all over again," she said at a rally after church. "And he wants to have a new system that would be quite challenging because you would have to give up the insurance you have now, and it would cost a lot of money. The goal is a good goal -- I absolutely agree with that -- but the last thing our country needs now is to be thrown into another contentious debate about health care." (David Weigel)

The Review-Journal reports that Sanders has spent twice as much on TV ads in Nevada as Clinton, $2.93 million to $1.46 million.

Trolling HRC, the conservative super PAC American Crossroads launched a $42,000 digital buy to highlight hardline comments sheâ€™s made about illegal immigration during previous races. Watch here.

-- â€œDebate rips open GOP wounds, and party risks tearing itself apart,â€ by Robert Costa and Philip Rucker: â€œThe GOP is at risk of tearing itself apart over its past as it heads into the thick of the primary season. A day after a debate marked by personal, petty exchanges, Republicans were grappling with their core beliefs, as well as the image they were broadcasting to the country â€¦ The increasingly harsh discussions of these and other issues amount to an existential crisis within the Republican Party and reflect the growing influence of non-ideological, populist voters. Contenders are making their most concerted effort yet to stop Trump [in South Carolina], even though previous attempts to take him down have attained little. The escalating quarreling may increase the likelihood of a long, expensive and potentially futile effort â€¦ As the candidates returned to the campaign trail, the mess they left behind on the stage of Greenvilleâ€™s Peace Center had some party strategists wondering whether the damage may be politically irreparable.â€

-- â€œWhat made the friendship between Scalia and Ginsburg work,â€ by Irin Carmon: â€œNino and RBG, the courtâ€™s most famous odd couple friendship stood as an example of warmth and professionalism across traditional divides â€¦ The reserved Clinton appointee and the bombastic Reagan pick had vastly different views on the constitution and the role of the court. And yet. One former clerk told us Scalia was Ginsburgâ€™s favored souvenir shopping buddy when they traveled together. On a trip to India, they famously rode an elephant, with Scalia sitting up front. They shared New Yearâ€™s Eves with their families and friends. In 2010, when Chief Justice Roberts announced [Ginsburgâ€™s husband] Martyâ€™s death from the bench, Scalia wiped tears from his eyes â€¦ Whether or not it was how Scalia saw it, for Ginsburg their public friendship also made a statement about the court as an institution: that it was strengthened by respectful debate, that it could work no matter how polarized its members were.â€

-- â€œA mini world war rages in the fields of Aleppo,â€ by Liz Sly: â€œAcross the olive groves and wheat fields of the northern Syrian province of Aleppo, a battle with global dimensions risks erupting into a wider war. Russian warplanes are bombing from the sky. Iraqi and Lebanese militias aided by Iranian advisers are advancing on the ground. An assortment of Syrian rebels backed by the United States, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are fighting to hold them back. Kurdish forces are taking advantage of the chaos, [while] the Islamic State has snatched a couple of small villages â€¦ Syriaâ€™s civil war long ago mutated into a proxy conflict, with competing world powers backing the rival Syrian factions almost since the earliest days of the armed rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad. But perhaps never before have the dangers â€” or the complications â€” of what amounts to a mini world war been so apparent as in the battle underway for control of Aleppo.â€

-- Doug Sosnikâ€™s take on the road ahead: The Democratic strategist, who served as a close adviser to Bill Clinton during his presidency, is known in Washington for insightful memos that diagnose the national mood. We got the latest one. Three nuggets jumped outâ€”

Independents will see the 2016 election as a choice between the lesser of two evils: â€œThis yearâ€™s Republican primary is the most rightward leaning since 1964, while Democrats have not been this far to the left since the 1972 campaign. As the parties have become increasingly ideological, Americans have drifted away from both of them. Self-identified independents are at near historic levels. â€¦ In this period of profound alienation, with both parties engaging in harsh ideological primaries, the public is likely to view the entire political process as a race to the bottom. They will be inclined to view their choice for president through the prism of which candidate is the least flawed and poses the least threat to their future well-being.â€

Obamaâ€™s approval rating is remarkably durable: â€œSince the summer of 2009, when these divisions began to intensify, Obamaâ€™s positive job approval ratings have remained flat, never going below 40% or above 53%. A closer look at these numbers shows the impact that age, race and income have had on his ratings. The narrow band reflects little movement from Obamaâ€™s core supporters, as well as steadfast opposition from his detractors.â€

The Democratic primary in New York will matter: â€œIn the period between the March primaries and the middle of April, fewer than 400 delegates will be selected. With the exception of the Wisconsin primary on April 5th, most of the attention will be focused on the New York (Wall Street) primary on April 19th. The last two key dates during the primary will be April 26th, when five northeastern states will select 384 delegates, and June 7th when California and five other states west of the Mississippi will hold elections.â€

Others joked about a presidential race that seems like it will never end:

-- â€œREVENGE OF THE POPULISTSâ€ is the headline on the front page of The State to describe the success of Trump and Sanders. The Columbia, S.C., newspaper searches for historical antecedents: â€œTrump rails against immigrants, echoing the nativist, mid-1800s Know Nothing Party that grew out of fears that an influx of Catholic immigrants was threatening the American way of life. Sandersâ€™ outcry against banks and corporations has its roots in the populist movement of the late 1800s, formed by a coalition of laborers and farmers, suffering, they said, under high loan and railroad rates that lined the eliteâ€™s pockets.â€

The article emphasizes similarities in their messaging and supporters: â€œAngst over the economy â€” as in populist movements of the past â€” has led to similar lines of attack from Trump and Sanders. â€This is not a rising-tide-that-lifts-all-boats recovery,â€™ said Danielle Vinson, a Furman University political scientist. â€¦ Both Trump and Sanders, for instance, denounce trade deals â€¦ Both have taken more isolationist stances in foreign policy â€¦ Both also have cast Washington politicians as shills for corporate interests.â€

-- The State also looks at the 12 percent of South Carolina voters who say they are undecided: â€œRetired oncologist Tripp Jones say his choice presents a dilemma in Saturdayâ€™s Republican presidential primary. None of the six candidates left in the GOP field fits the bill for Jones, a longtime Republican who â€wants somebody who is going to take America to the next level but has common sense.â€™ Jones is among the 1-in-8 Republicans who are undecided as Saturdayâ€™s primary looms. Political ads do little for him. â€Iâ€™ve got to settle on one, but I donâ€™t have a clue yet who it will be,â€™ he said. Other voters plan to wait until the end. â€Iâ€™m going to let it all play out,â€™ said Irmo Town Councilwoman Kathy Condom, who plans to vote Republican. â€Iâ€™ll figure it out on the 19th (of February).â€™â€

Who they are --> Politico, â€œThe Whale That Nearly Drowned The Donald,â€ by Michael Crowley: â€œAkio Kashiwagi was a mysterious figure reputed to have underworld connections. He was one of the worldâ€™s top five gamblers, a â€whaleâ€™ in casino parlance, willing to wager $10 million in a single gaming bender. After his murder, one unnamed executive told the paper that Kashiwagi had owed the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino $4 million â€¦ The story of Kashiwagi, drawn from Trumpâ€™s memoirs and news accounts from the day, offers a revealing window into Trumpâ€™s instincts. It shows that Trump isnâ€™t just a one-time casino ownerâ€”heâ€™s also a gambler, prone to impulsive, even reckless action. Trump is obsessed with winning, a topic he usually brings up in the context of his merciless deal-making style. But a crucial question about any would-be president who may be confronted with questions of war and peace is his attitude toward risk. Some presidents are highly averse to it â€¦ Others roll the dice.â€

-- The Atlantic, â€œThe 'New Look' of the Post-Obama Electorate,â€ by Theodore R. Johnson: â€œIn 2008, when then-Senator Barack Obama rode the highest black voter turnout in U.S. history to the White House, black voters felt The Look had been exchanged â€¦ African American voters felt that a black president could give them special attention and understand black Americaâ€™s grievances better than any other. It wasnâ€™t favoritism African Americans sought; they simply wanted an acknowledgement that structural racism is real and some executive resolve to address it from the first president to have experienced it firsthand. But things havenâ€™t gone quite as they had hoped. The welled-up hope that racism would be a presidential priority and undergo an incremental process of amelioration began to slowly dissipate in the face of politics as usual â€¦ And frustration has given rise to a new generation of black voters and activists, a generation who uses more overt and dynamic techniques to influence the political agenda.â€

--The New Yorker, â€œCan Cruz Beat Trump on Conservative Principles?,â€ by Ryan Lizza: â€œTed Cruz is the best political tactician in the Republican race. But for all of Cruzâ€™s tactical successes so far, he made one enormous mistake: he misunderstood the threat posed by Trump. By repeatedly praising Trump throughout 2015, Cruz did more than any other Republican to validate the reality-TV star as a true conservative â€¦ Cruz, the most well-funded conservative, stuck to his hug-Trump strategy until just a few days before the Iowa caucuses. At the CBS debate, [he] tried desperately to undo that damage, and his attempt to unmask Trump as a closet liberal led to the most fiery exchange of the evening. And now there is a new accelerant to the Cruzâ€“Bush campaign to turn Trump into a liberal: Antonin Scaliaâ€™s death. For many ideological conservatives, the makeup of the Supreme Court is the most important issue in America â€¦ [and] the success of Cruzâ€™s campaign may depend on that fight.â€

-- New York Times, â€œA Leisurely Return for the New York State Legislature,â€ by Jesse McKinley: â€œLast week, [New Yorkâ€™s] 213 elected lawmakers â€” or as many who were able to attend â€” gathered for a couple of hours, passed a few minor bills and some well-meaning resolutions, and then formally adjourned for a 14-day winter break, officially ending their workweek. The time was 1:32 p.m. On a Tuesday. Two months after the corruption convictions of Sheldon Silver and Dean G. Skelos, the former leaders of the State Assembly and Senate â€¦ that sense of urgency has seemingly dissipated, unable to penetrate the intractable culture of Albany: The 2016 Legislature has yet to offer any new bills related to ethics reform, and the leaders have been noncommittal on a raft of proposals made by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The stateâ€™s lawmakers have responded with a leisurely return to well-established habits, marked by two-day weeks in the capital, six-minute floor sessions and a collection of one-house bills with little or no chance of becoming law.â€

-- At the White House: President Obama is still in California, where he'll meet with leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Rancho Mirage throughout the day.

-- On the campaign trail: Bernie Sanders is in Ypsilanti and Dearborn, Mich., while John Kasich stops in Allendale, East Lansing and Utica. Hillary Clinton is in Elko and Reno, Nevada. The rest of the field is in South Carolina. Here's the rundown:

NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:

-- I guess this is what they call a â€œwintry mixâ€? â€œAfter an overnight burst, snow may be slow to get going early on, but should pick up by mid-morning,â€ the Capital Weather Gang forecasts. â€œDuring the course of the afternoon, snow likely changes to sleet and freezing rain from south to north. Temperatures remain below freezing keeping those untreated surfaces very slick. Highs range from 25-30.â€

INTRIGUE: Vince Gray is running against the woman he anointed to succeed him on the D.C. Council. â€œHis former protege insists she is not retreating,â€ Paul Schwartzman reports. â€œYvette Alexander, in an interview, accused Gray of chall
