Puerto Rico defaults on a $422-million debt payment Sunday, but Congress can't agree on a rescue plan with both Democratic and Republican lawmakers wary of any bailout bill.

A member of a labor union shouts slogans while holding a Puerto Rico flag during a protest in San Juan September 11, 2015. Thousands of public sector workers demonstrated on Friday against an austerity plan to help pull Puerto Rico out of a massive debt crisis, saying the private sector should take more of the pain. The island's government is calling for shared sacrifice, and concessions from citizens and investors alike, as it tries to lift itself out of a $72 billion debt hole.

Puerto Ricoâ€™s May 1 deadline on a $422-million debt payment has arrived, and US lawmakers are no closer to finding a solution for the islandâ€™s financial woes.

Most of Sundayâ€™s payment is principal and interest due from the Government Development Bank, Puerto Ricoâ€™s main bond issuer and fiscal agent.

â€œThat deadline is imminent, but Republicans in the House and Democrats in the administration are still haggling over the terms of a bill to rescue Puerto Rico,â€ writes The New York Times. â€œMissing the payment risks further destabilizing its shrunken economy. And there are concerns that the passage of any legislation could be delayed until the island nears the tipping point of its debt woes: a $2-billion debt payment due on July 1.â€

Before Congress left Washington Friday for a weeklong recess, legislators were deadlocked over any plan that could be seen as similar to bailout bills of the 2008 financial crisis. Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) is leading a draft of a tentative rescue plan in the House, but it has faced opposition from legislators in both parties who see the bill as nothing more than a bailout.

â€œFor me, I think to any human being, â€bailoutâ€™ means youâ€™re going to get money to solve your problem,â€ said Representative Bishop. But the bill would â€œgive Puerto Rico access to a court-enforced debt restructuring in exchange for the imposition of a federal fiscal oversight board,â€ so the island would get no direct money out of the deal. â€œSo to say itâ€™s a bailout, itâ€™s obviously not just a stretch of the meaning of the word, there has to [be] an ulterior motive.â€

Puerto Ricoâ€™s Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla is frustrated with Washingtonâ€™s inaction because he has warned about a default on Sundayâ€™s deadline for months. And while Washington may be at a standstill, the financial crisis has everyday implications for the 3.47 million people who call Puerto Rico home.

The islandâ€™s unemployment rate was 11.8 percent in March, more than twice  the overall US rate of five percent. Tens of thousands of government workers have been laid off since 2009 to cut costs and 10 percent of the islandâ€™s schools have been closed since 2014.

These personal hardships along with others have led to Puerto Ricoâ€™s largest mass exodus in the last 50 years. The island county has witnessed a 9 percent population decline in the 21st century, with almost seven percent occurring between 2010 and 2015.

â€œPopulation growth was once the norm in Puerto Rico,â€ explains Pew Research in a March study of population data from the US Census Bureau. â€œThe islandâ€™s population grew by 10% from 1980 to 1990, and by 8% from 1990 to 2000. But as the effects of a decade-long economic recession have mounted, Puerto Ricans â€“ who are US citizens at birth â€“ have increasingly moved to the US mainland, with many settling in Florida.â€

According to the Census Bureau data, economic opportunity is a primary driver for the mass outmigration: 40 percent of the island-born Puerto Ricans moving to the continental US say their main reason for moving was job-related, and another 39 percent cite "family and household" reasons.

But the continental US is not immune to Puerto Ricoâ€™s financial ills.

â€œA massive default from Puerto Rican bonds can create a financial contagion in the US municipal bond market,â€ Jose Caraballo-Cueto, Director of the Census Information Center at the University of Puerto Rico, writes for NBC News. And the new influx of Puerto Ricans to the continental US will further strain our countryâ€™s public services, adds Dr. Caraballo-Cueto, as the majority of islanders moving to the mainland are very poor. â€œMoreover, U.S. exports â€“ especially agricultural products â€“ to Puerto Rico will be reduced even further if the Great Depression of Puerto Rico deepens.â€

And regardless of future side effects of the islandâ€™s bankruptcy on the overall US economy, the US government has â€œa shared responsibilityâ€ on Puerto Ricoâ€™s crisis, notes Caraballo-Cueto. Not only has the US banned Puerto Ricoâ€™s access to federal and local bankruptcy laws that could have restructured 70 percent of the countryâ€™s debt, but it has also upheld a marine law from 1920, the Jones Act, that cripples the countryâ€™s international trading by essentially only permitting US ships to enter or leave Puerto Rican ports as all other foreign vessels are subject to absurdly high customs and import fees.

â€œMost people think July 1 is atomic bomb day,â€ Sergio Marxuach, public policy director of the Center for a New Economy in Puerto Rico, tells The Washington Post. â€œ May 1 is still significant.â€
