But Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s reelection was regarded with apathy by many Palestinians in the West Bank, and some even welcomed the news â€“ albeit as the best of several bad options.

â€œUnder Netanyahu things will deteriorate. But if it canâ€™t get any better, it might as well get worse,â€ Ahmad, who declined to give his full name, told Salon. His customers, browsing for phone accessories in central Ramallah, agreed. When youâ€™re in the West Bank it doesnâ€™t much matter whoâ€™s in the Knesset: settlement expansion, military crackdowns and wars have taken place on the watch of both the left and right, and thereâ€™s been realistic progress toward statehood under neither.

â€œThe experience of the Palestinians is clear. Since the assassination of Rabin, nothing in Israeli politics has brought something good,â€ Huneida Ghanem, the general director of the Palestinian Forum for Israeli Studies (MADAR), told Salon. â€œTime and time again, election after election after election has just brought something worse. Palestinians see this and in their head, they understand that nothing is going to change, that it will just get worse and worse.â€

This year, Ghanem said, some did hope that Herzog and Livni had the potential to change things â€“ a wish that only makes Netanyahuâ€™s win even more disappointing. But she also believes that any trust in the pairâ€™s center-left Zionist Union, which until the electionâ€™s final hours was billed as a likely winner, is misplaced. The sense is echoed across the West Bank, where most dismiss the Israeli opposition with a laugh, refusing to refer to it as â€œleft wingâ€ in any meaningful sense.

â€œNetanyahu, Herzog, Lieberman: if anyone from those Zionist parties become prime minister it wonâ€™t make any difference. They all have the same strategy to fulfill their ideology,â€ Bassam Shweiki told Salon. A literature enthusiast and activist, Shweiki speaks English with a London twang despite the fact heâ€™s lived most of his life in Hebron. A West Bank city carved up by Israeli settlement enclaves and military closures,  the city barely featured in election campaigns aside from a pro-settlement visit by right-winger Avigdor Lieberman.

â€œThe Zionist ideology says Israel is the homeland for the Jewish people that God promised, so thereâ€™s no place for any other nations in the promised land,â€ Shweiki continued. â€œThe strategy is to hold the peace process without announcing its death, while continuing to establish settlements, demolishing homes, confiscating Palestinian lands and so on, while deceiving the world by saying that there are negotiations.â€

Shweikiâ€™s view that expansion is inevitable in Zionism is shared by most in the West Bank, and itâ€™s the reason many are even pleased at Netanyahuâ€™s win. Unlike other leaders, they believe, he wonâ€™t obscure that fact, and with policies of occupation laid bare, pressure on Israel for a just solution can only increase.

â€œPersonally Iâ€™m glad that he won. This proves to the world that it is Israel and its people that do not want peace,â€ Amer Khader, a postgraduate nutritionist from Ramallah, told Salon. â€œHis speech was clearly stating that if he wins the Palestinian State will not see the light, that Jerusalem is forever the capital of the state of Israel, and for the continuation of the illegal settlements in the West Bank.

â€œWhatâ€™s the worst that can happen? More houses to be taken when more than 2,000 have been demolished in East Jerusalem? Another war on Gaza? Itâ€™s already destroyed. More settlements? Let it be. It is just more isolation of Israel through its racist discriminatory apartheid policies.â€

The bleak irony in Khaderâ€™s view comes from long experience. Even for those Palestinians who are able to vote â€“ those citizens of Israel who make up some 20 percent of its population â€“ the achievements of this election have transpired partly from the countryâ€™s right wing shooting itself in the foot. Last year, Israeli lawmakers raised the electoral threshold, a move supported in part by right-wingers who hoped it would push small Arab parties out of representation altogether. Instead, several Palestinian and left-wing parties banded together to create the Joint List, a broad coalition that won 14 seats and made Arab Israelis the third biggest power in the Knesset. Even as they bemoaned the Knessetâ€™s rightward tilt, its leaders celebrated a new era of Palestinian political involvement on election night. â€œI came here to see resistance and to be proud of my community, to get the best for us and to further our aims of two states,â€ 18-year-old Razi Misherqui, wearing a party T-shirt and draped in a Palestinian flag, told Salon as the results came in. â€œI think Arab unity is really important and  we can use this to show that we can make change and challenge whatâ€™s going on.â€ In Ramallah, Ghanem called the Joint List victory the â€œsurprise storyâ€ of the election, and it was the only reason that many Palestinians bothered to watch the political news at all. But that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s a game-changer. Many Arab Israelis, believing any political activity in the Knesset is doomed to fail, still boycott the elections and even the Joint Listâ€™s most ardent supporters are measured in their optimism. Even as he pledged to challenge the consensus of the election, leading Joint List MK Ahmad Tibi bemoaned a â€œdisappointingâ€ result in which the â€œextreme right-wing got the upper hand.â€ And in the West Bank, where Palestinians havenâ€™t been able to vote for their own representation in nearly a decade, hope for any changes the joint list might make is guarded. With peace negotiations bearing only bitter fruit, an occupation with no clear end and a political mood characterized by frustration and extremism, the only sure thing about the path to a solution is that it will be tough. â€œNothing is going to come from the Israeli state if the Israelis donâ€™t feel they donâ€™t pay any price for the Israeli occupation,â€ Ghanem told Salon. â€œThe last 10 years theyâ€™ve been building up this right-wing narrative, this plan for Eretz Israel in the political scene. Things that were once unacceptable to talk about are now part of the hegemonic discourse in Israel. And Iâ€™m not talking about buses on Shabbat, Iâ€™m talking about fascist, discriminatory policies â€“ the settlement enterprise, the occupation. â€œPeople feel very failed by the international community,â€ she added. â€œAs theyâ€™ve grown older they put so much hope into the peace process. Over the years theyâ€™ve tried violence, and that didnâ€™t work; the intifada, and that didnâ€™t work; peaceful resistance, and none of it worked. And then the international community came to them saying if you do this, if you do this, you can have a state. But theyâ€™ve done that, and itâ€™s led nowhere.â€ Still, thereâ€™s a strong feeling in the West Bank that change from the outside looks more likely than from within the Israeli state. Real international pressure and action, Ghanem said, with a strong stress on the word â€œreal,â€ is the best hope for statehood. If thatâ€™s the case, Khader said, than a Netanyahu win might be a blessing in disguise. â€œNetanyahu is the worst for the economy of Israel and its international relations. And the only way Israel will get weaker is through screwing their own relations, which is happening,â€ he told Salon. â€œLet it be. It wonâ€™t get any better till it is screwed.â€
