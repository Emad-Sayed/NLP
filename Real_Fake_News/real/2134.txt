And the results, as everyone whoâ€™s been paying even minimal attention to the Republican primary campaign so far knows by this time, means the mediaâ€™s proverbial â€œbrokered conventionâ€ may just be coming true this time. We call it the more politically correct â€œcontested conventionâ€ because nobody likes the idea that men in the smoke-filled room will maneuver to choose a candidate behind the scenes and put him on the ticket regardless of the will of the voters. But that is exactly what is being discussed if Trump doesnâ€™t go into the convention with enough delegates to win on the first ballot.

Itâ€™s possible that Ted Cruz will be able to wrangle enough votes to take the lead on the second ballot but since itâ€™s unlikely to be very close, that scenario doesnâ€™t look good either. And thatâ€™s despite the fact that he has the support of much of the hardcore conservative movement which today that would consider Ronald Reagan a liberal squish if they hadnâ€™t been indoctrinated for 30 years into believing that he fulfilled every GOP fever dream of his time without ever having to compromise in any way. The establishment wants a â€œfresh face.â€

If last nightâ€™s reaction by Trump to this possibility is any indication, heâ€™s hunkering down for an epic battle. He gave no speech or â€œpress conferenceâ€ as he has done in the past. Instead his campaign issued a statement:

Donald J. Trump withstood the onslaught of the establishment yet again, Lyinâ€™ Ted Cruz had the Governor of Wisconsin, many conservative talk radio hosts, and the entire party apparatus behind him. Not only was he propelled by the anti-Trump Super PACâ€™s spending countless millions of dollars on false advertising against Mr. Trump, but he was coordinating with his own Super PACâ€™s (which is illegal) who totally control him. Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet â€” he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump. We have total confidence that Mr. Trump will go on to win in New York, where he holds a substantial lead in all the polls, and beyond. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who can secure the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton, or whomever is the Democratic nominee, in order to Make American Great Again.

Basically, Trump accused Cruz of stealing the Wisconsin primary with the illegal help of his Super PAC and the GOP establishment. It is tantamount to a declaration of war.

The Trojan Horse metaphor isnâ€™t really on point, but the idea that certain rich donors and elected officials in the GOP are supporting Cruz for their own purposes is correct. They simply want him to block Trump so they can install a candidate more to their liking. Mitt Romney has been very upfront about that. Itâ€™s just that until recently Trump didnâ€™t understand how the convention worked or that part of the game is working the delegates at state conventions. (He was reportedly fit to be tied when he found out and blamed his staff for failing him.)

But now that heâ€™s up on the rules, heâ€™s hired some experienced hands to handle these tactical details. including one of the most talented â€œdelegate huntersâ€ in the business, Paul Manafort. According to RealClear Politics:

You donâ€™t have to read between the lines to see that Trump is angry. And as he is the first to tell you, he believes that when you get hit, you hit back â€” hard. So it was unsurprising to find out that his close friend and former campaign adviser Roger Stone, the notorious dirty trickster, has a project to benefit Trump called â€œStoptheSteal.org.â€ All the way back in February, he predicted the establishment was going to try to â€œstealâ€ the election from Trump and announced that he was planning to â€œreach out to some of my old associatesâ€ in order to â€œpull together some of the best convention operatives in America today.â€ He said, â€œWe have set up a fund to pay for their travel, to pay for their hotel rooms, to bring them to Cleveland to avoid the steal.â€

Last week he put out a call: Go to Cleveland. Come to Cleveland. Donâ€™t let the big steal go forward without massive protest. Peaceful, nonviolent protest. So, as they used to say, donâ€™t wait for orders from headquarters. Ride to the sound of the guns. I donâ€™t mean to imply violence on that. I mean: Ride to where the action will be. We have to let the Republican bosses and the kingmakers and the insiders and the lobbyists know that weâ€™re not going to stand for the big steal. So if you are a Trump supporter, make plans now. Take a bus! Hitchhike! Carpool! Take a train! Fly, if you can afford it. We need you in Cleveland! On Monday, harking back to the 1968 Democratic convention violence,  he described his plan for the RNC as â€œdays of rageâ€ which â€œcould entail protests at certain targeted hotels where delegations who are involved in the â€big stealâ€™ are staying.â€ He claims that heâ€™s getting an excellent response. One can certainly imagine how â€œenragedâ€ Trump voters will be if it looks as though they are being denied the nomination due to machinations from the political elite. As Politico reported yesterday: 96 percent of [Trumpâ€™s] supporters said the U.S. needs a powerful leader to solve its problems, 91 percent said their beliefs and values are being threatened, and 90 percent said public officials donâ€™t care much about what everyday people think. â€œTrump supporters are true stand-outs,â€ Quinnipiac poll director Douglas Schwartz said. â€œThey want a leader who is very different from the leader sought by other voters, explaining the mystery many see behind Trumpâ€™s support.â€ The Republican front-runnerâ€™s supporters even value his bombastic rhetoric. Eighty-four percent said the U.S. needs a leader who will do or say anything to fix the countryâ€™s issues, a statement just 68 percent of GOP voters overall agreed with (60 percent of Democrats disagree). The heightened concentration of Trump backers with strong feelings about being marginalized and having a bleak view of government is a consistent theme throughout the survey, as illustrated by the nine-in-10 supporters who view his campaign as a movement. One might assume Stoneâ€™s project is just another wingnut scam designed to liberate some hard-earned money from the true believers. But Stone is no joke when it comes to this sort of operation. He was an integral part of one of the most consequential â€œprotestsâ€ in recent history: the so-called Brooks-Brothers â€œriotâ€ that shut down the counting of votes in Miami, one of the important steps that led to the installation of George W. Bush as president. Last night after Cruz was declared the winner, this was announced: Newest expected hire for the Trump campaign â€“ former NY Rep. John Sweeney Sweeney was once named one of the 20 Most Corrupt Members of Congress. But heâ€™s most famous for something else: During the 2000 election, Sweeney allegedly helped earn his nickname from President Bush, â€œCongressman Kickass,â€ by organizing the so-called Brooks Brothers riot that disrupted the Florida elections commissioners. He was said to have led the charge on the third recount in Miami, flying in astroturfing GOP operatives and instructing them to â€œshut it down!â€ by raising a clamor and pounding on the election commissionâ€™s doors. Sweeney used the words â€œthugsâ€ to describe the Florida officials involved in the recount. Theyâ€™re getting the band back together. A majority of Wisconsin Republicans told the exit pollsters they thought whoever comes in with the most delegates should win, so Trump has some popular backing for that notion. But thatâ€™s a very unlikely outcome. Trump is signaling that heâ€™s not going to go down without a full-fledged bloody battle on the floor of he convention if he comes up short. And in case anyone thinks that Stone isnâ€™t conferring with Trump on his plans for these â€œdays of rage,â€ listen to the interview Stone gave to John Heileman and Mark Halperin on the subject. Youâ€™ll notice that he uses the â€œTrojan Horseâ€ metaphor too. It could be coincidence â€” but I doubt it.
