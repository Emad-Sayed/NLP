What an amazing and weird moment in political history weâ€™re living through. We all saw something on Thursday night that, in over 200 years of American existence, no one had ever seen before: a woman accept a major-party nomination for the presidency. Thatâ€™s an incredible achievement, attained by the nominee through years of struggle, setbacks, and steady forward motion. The magnitude of Hillary Clintonâ€™s accomplishment guarantees her a spot in the history books, and those of us who witnessed her make that history wonâ€™t soon forget the impression it left.

The weird counterpoint to the Democratsâ€™ elevation of a candidate who represents continued social progress is, of course, the Republicansâ€™ nomination of Donald Trump. The Democratic convention was intended to serve both as a response to the fear and disunity offered by Trumpism, and a push to steal from the Republicans all the themes and campaign messages Trumpism eschews: optimism, patriotism, and a sense of shared purpose. Clintonâ€™s speech accepting the Democratic Partyâ€™s nomination was the capstone of that effort, serving as a call to unity, offering an outstretched hand to those alienated by Trump, and sketching out an optimistic vision of Americaâ€™s future.

Hillaryâ€™s provocations of Trump were relentless. She said he â€œwants to divide us from the rest of the world and from each other.â€ She quipped that â€œheâ€™s taken the Republican Party a long way: from â€Morning in Americaâ€™ to â€Midnight in America.â€™â€ Trumpâ€™s megalomaniacal declaration that â€œI alone can fix itâ€ was slung around his neck as Clinton framed it as fundamentally alien to the American tradition. â€œHeâ€™s forgetting every last one of us,â€ she said. â€œAmericans donâ€™t say: â€I alone can fix it.â€™ We say: â€Weâ€™ll fix it together.â€™â€ In tackling Trumpâ€™s fitness for the office, Clinton made enthusiastic use of The Zinger. â€œImagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis,â€ she said. â€œA man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.â€ The obvious intent behind all this was to goad Trump into responding and validating the attack. (His surrogates tried responding to the speech in real time, and they faceplanted in characteristic fashion.)

The Trump flensing also provided the necessary contrast for Hillary to sketch out her bright-and-happy vision for the country. After ticking off a laundry list of intractable problems â€“ rising inequality, decreased social mobility, stagnant wages, and persistent gridlock â€“ Hillary went long on optimism:

But just look at the strengths we bring to meet these challenges. We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world. We have the most tolerant and generous young people weâ€™ve ever had. We have the most powerful military. The most innovative entrepreneurs. The most enduring values. Freedom and equality, justice and opportunity. We should be so proud that these words are associated with us. That when people hear them, they hear America. So donâ€™t let anyone tell you that our country is weak. Weâ€™re not. Donâ€™t let anyone tell you we donâ€™t have what it takes. We do. No one heard anything like that at the Republican convention, and voters didnâ€™t hear much in the way of sustained optimism from any Republican candidate this cycle. So Hillary grabbed that ball and ran with it, making a direct appeal to voters whoâ€™ve been left cold by the GOPâ€™s embrace of Trump: â€œWhatever party you belong to, or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign.â€ It was a bold move on Clintonâ€™s part, not least because there are a lot of voters who donâ€™t feel especially optimistic right at this moment for all the reasons Hillary laid out in her speech: stuck wages, limited mobility, and exclusion from economic growth. As an answer to these frustrations, Clinton explicitly acknowledged that the Democrats have been kinda terrible at speaking to those concerns. â€œSome of you are frustrated, even furious. And you know what? Youâ€™re right,â€ she said. â€œDemocrats are the party of working people, but we havenâ€™t done a good enough job showing that we get what youâ€™re going through, and that weâ€™re going to do something about it.â€ All told, Hillary Clintonâ€™s speech to the 2016 Democratic National Convention was a singular moment in American politics. We saw the first female presidential nominee from a major party telling voters that things will be better, and that we can all do better, and that the best way to get there is to reject the allure of a would-be strongman and work together. We saw a woman reach an unprecedented height in American politics and offer herself as the alternative to a candidate who busily plumbs new depths. It was quite a thing to see.
