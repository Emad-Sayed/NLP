There is â€“ and perhaps there always will be â€“ a dedicated group of people who donâ€™t know Hillary Clinton personally, but nonetheless hate her.

Whether they are truly a â€œvast rightwing conspiracyâ€ (as Clinton called them in 1998) or just many in number and conservative in outlook, thereâ€™s no arguing that they exist or that they continue to try to influence public opinion on the Democratic nominee.



But even if people consider themselves savvy enough to reject the strangest conspiracy theories (sample claims include that she is a mass-murderer, a closeted lesbian faking her 40-year marriage, a member of the Illuminati and/or an agent of the devil himself), there seems little doubt that an undercurrent of hostility spanning decades has had an impact upon how she is viewed.

Clintonâ€™s unfavorability rating may not be as low as Donald Trumpâ€™s, but in an election year which has frequently degenerated into name-calling, she has attracted invective from both the left and the right. Polls have frequently cited the public view that she is not trusted, while Trump has rallied his supporters with the â€œCrooked Hillaryâ€ epithet.

Her links to Wall Street, her missing emails and her supposed responsibility for the security failures that contributed to the attack on the Benghazi consulate are the ostensible reasons for some deeply personal attacks in 2016. But the roots of hostility towards her go much deeper.

Craig Shirley, a Ronald Reagan biographer and historian who spent decades as a conservative political consultant, said that, when Hillary Clinton arrived in Washington DC as first lady, â€œshe came from Little Rock with a reputation already establishedâ€ as â€œsuch a militant feminist, difficult to deal withâ€.

He noted that she faced hostility in Arkansas politics and media when Bill Clinton was first elected governor, because she kept her maiden name.â€œHere she comes, the feminist from Wellesley and Yale,â€ Shirley explained of the supposedly prevailing attitude of the time, â€œdown to Little Rock and brings her attitudes with herâ€.

So by the time she arrived on the national stage in 1991, during Bill Clintonâ€™s presidential campaign, the then-still-mostly-male press corps already had an idea of who they understood Hillary Clinton to be â€“ a potential liability to her husbandâ€™s political career whose feminism and ambition were a bit unseemly. 



And, as she noted in her first autobiography, she gave them plenty of material with which to support that narrative. First, there was her much-maligned â€œIâ€™m not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynetteâ€ comment in response to a reporterâ€™s assertion that she and her husband had â€œsome sort of understanding and arrangementâ€ about his infidelity.

Then, her out-of-context â€œI suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookiesâ€ comment, which came in response to attacks, which the Clintons denied, by now-California governor Jerry Brown that she had only been a successful lawyer because her husband had steered business to her firm, implying that she should have confined herself to being a ceremonial first lady.

And then, of course, came the scandals in which she was involved: Whitewater, a money-losing land deal in which sheâ€™d invested for their retirement with two friends who managed the investment illegally; and Travelgate, in which she â€“ contrary to the then-normal practice of leaving the business of the White House to the presidentâ€™s staff â€“ was said to have ordered the firing of the head of the travel office, who coincidentally was popular with the mostly-male White House press corps whose travel he arranged.

The key question raised about Whitewater and Travelgate was not whether Clinton had done anything actually wrong, but whether she had used illegal means to try to keep the media from finding out. The Starr investigation, which eventually resulted in Bill Clintonâ€™s impeachment, found that she had not, but by that time her reputation was established as someone unfriendly to the media who also maybe did not do the right thing.

Shirley conceded that â€œthe press pounded on herâ€ first in Arkansas and then in Washington, but did not believe that affected her relationship with the media, or that it was a driving factor in peopleâ€™s attitudes towards her. â€œThereâ€™s something about her manner, persona, voice, smirk that just grates on a lot of people,â€ he said. â€œPeople donâ€™t like to be talked down to, and she has a terrible habit of talking down to people, with that smirk.â€

However, Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served in Bill Clintonâ€™s administration, said she did not think that peopleâ€™s dislike of Hillary Clinton is her own fault. â€œThis business of people â€not likingâ€™ her is shaped by expectations, by television, by what we think people in authority ought to look like, and not who she actually is,â€ she said.



â€œShe is absolutely as likable, or more likable, than many male politicians,â€ she said. But while it is rare that people will compare a male politician they do not like to their fathers Kamarck noted that Clinton â€œreminds people of their mothers, or the schoolteacher they didnâ€™t like.â€ (References to a â€œnagging wifeâ€ and â€œbitchy wifeâ€ are also common.)

â€œI think thereâ€™s some misogyny in that,â€ said Kamarck, noting that itâ€™s exceedingly common for men who donâ€™t hew to conventional standards of attractiveness to be on television or pursue political careers, while women are more likely to be granted that visibility when they are younger and if they meet traditional beauty standards.

â€œWe will overcome this but, right now, the world is accustomed to saying old men are fine, theyâ€™re strong, theyâ€™re wise,â€ she added. â€œOld women, weâ€™re not so sure.â€
