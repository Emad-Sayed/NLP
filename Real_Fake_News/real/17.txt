After a week of nonstop criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike for comments many condemned as racially charged, Donald Trump claims to be altering his campaign to be a little more inclusive. While the presumptive G.O.P. has long promised to â€œmake America great again,â€ Trump now says heâ€™s adding two words to slogan to illustrate just how non-racist he really is.

â€œYou know, I have the theme â€make America great again,â€™ and I've added a couple of things,â€ Trump announced to supporters at a campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, on Friday night. â€œRight now Iâ€™m adding make America great againâ€”Iâ€™m adding â€for everyone,â€™ because itâ€™s really going to be for everyone. Itâ€™s not going to be for a group of people, itâ€™s going to be for everyone. Itâ€™s true.â€

The allegedly amended slogan, which has yet to appear on any official signage or Trump merchandise, comes after the presidential candidate spent the first half of June repeatedly denouncing Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge of Mexican heritage presiding over the Trump University class action lawsuit, as inherently biased against him. (Curiel was born in Indiana.) His comments were widely condemned by the Washington political establishment, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who suggested he may be an idiot, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called Trumpâ€™s statement the â€œtextbook definition of a racist comment.â€

Trump, who hasnâ€™t apologized or taken back any of his comments, indicated on Friday that he realized his words have had a negative effect on his campaign and declared he is not a racist.

â€œI am the least racist person. The least racist person that youâ€™ve ever seen. I mean give me a break,â€ he said at the rally. â€œI am the least racist person that youâ€™ve ever looked at, believe me.â€
