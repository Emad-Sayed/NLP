Conservatives are dismayed about the Supreme Courtâ€™s complicity in rewriting the Affordable Care Act â€” its ratification of the IRSâ€™s disregard of the statuteâ€™s plain and purposeful language. But they have contributed to this outcome. Their decades of populist praise of judicial deference to the political branches has borne this sour fruit.

The court says the ACAâ€™s stipulation that subsidies are to be administered by the IRS using exchanges â€œestablished by the Stateâ€ should not be construed to mean what it says. Otherwise the law will not reach as far as it will if federal exchanges can administer subsidies in states that choose not to establish exchanges. The ACAâ€™s legislative history, however, demonstrates that the subsidies were deliberately restricted to distribution through statesâ€™ exchanges in order to pressure the states into establishing their own exchanges.

The most durable damage from Thursdayâ€™s decision is not the perpetuation of the ACA, which can be undone by what created it â€” legislative action. The paramount injury is the courtâ€™s embrace of a duty to ratify and even facilitate lawless discretion exercised by administrative agencies and the executive branch generally.

The courtâ€™s decision flowed from many decisions by which the judiciary has written rules that favor the government in cases of statutory construction. The decision also resulted from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.â€™s embrace of the doctrine that courts, owing vast deference to the purposes of the political branches, are obligated to do whatever is required to make a law efficient, regardless of how the law is written. What Roberts does by way of, to be polite, creative construing (Justice Antonin Scalia, dissenting, calls it â€œsomersaults of statutory interpretationâ€) is legislating, not judging.

Roberts writes, almost laconically, that the ACA â€œcontains more than a few examples of inartful drafting.â€ That is his artful way of treating â€œinartfulâ€ as a synonym for â€œinconvenientâ€ or even â€œself-defeating.â€

Rolling up the sleeves of his black robe and buckling down to the business of redrafting the ACA, Roberts invents a corollary to â€œChevron deference.â€

Named for a 1984 case, Chevron deference has become central to the way todayâ€™s regulatory state functions. It says that agencies charged with administering statutes are entitled to deference when they interpret ambiguous statutory language. While purporting to not apply Chevron, Roberts expands it to empower all of the executive branch to ignore or rewrite congressional language that is not at all ambiguous but is inconvenient for the smooth operation of something Congress created. Exercising judicial discretion in the name of deference, Roberts enlarges executive discretion. He does so by validating what the IRS did when it ignored the ACAâ€™s text in order to disburse billions of dollars of subsidies through federal exchanges not established by the states.

Chevron deference does for executive agencies what the â€œrational basisâ€ test, another judicial invention, does for legislative discretion.

Since the New Deal, courts have permitted almost any legislative infringement of economic liberty that can be said to have a rational basis. Applying this extremely permissive test, courts usually approve any purpose that a legislature asserts. Courts even concoct purposes that legislatures neglect to articulate. This fulfills the Roberts Doctrine that it is a judicial function to construe laws in ways that make them perform better, meaning more efficiently, than they would as written by Congress.

Thursdayâ€™s decision demonstrates how easily, indeed inevitably, judicial deference becomes judicial dereliction, with anticonstitutional consequences. We are, says William R. Maurer of the Institute for Justice, becoming â€œa country in which all the branches of government work in tandem to achieve policy outcomes, instead of checking one another to protect individual rights. Besides violating the separation of powers, this approach raises serious issues about whether litigants before the courts are receiving the process that is due to them under the Constitution.â€

The Roberts Doctrine facilitates what has been for a century progressivismâ€™s central objective, the overthrow of the Constitutionâ€™s architecture. The separation of powers impedes progressivism by preventing government from wielding uninhibited power. Such power would result if its branches behaved as partners in harness rather than as wary, balancing rivals maintaining constitutional equipoise.

Roberts says â€œwe must respect the role of the Legislatureâ€ but â€œ[A] fair reading of legislation demands a fair understanding of the legislative plan.â€ However, he goes beyond â€œunderstandingâ€ the plan; he adopts a legislatorâ€™s role in order to rescue the legislatureâ€™s plan from the consequences of the legislatureâ€™s dubious decisions. By blurring, to the point of erasure, constitutional boundaries, he damages all institutions, not least his court.
