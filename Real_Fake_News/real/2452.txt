CARLYâ€™S MOMENTUM KEEPS GROWING

 No candidate in the Republican field has had a better two weeks than Carly Fiorina. Gallup polling out today compares views of the Republican contenders before and after the Aug. 6 Fox News debate in Cleveland. Favorable views of Fiorina are up an eye-popping 15 points, 3 points more than the two other debate winners, Ben Carson and John Kasich.

 

 â€œI went into the debate thinking this was an opportunity. An opportunity to introduce myself to Republican people,â€ Fiorina said in an interview on â€œPower Play with Chris Stirewalt.â€ â€œIt was an opportunity I was going to take full advantage of.â€

 

 But there were others who hoped for (and needed) standout showings. They saw sentiment collapse. Gallup shows Rand Paul, Rick Perry, Rick Santorum and Lindsey Graham took double-digit nosedives. Other, mostly better-known candidates saw little change. Donald Trump (17 percent net favorability) and Jeb Bush (27 percent net favorability) were essentially unchanged.

 

 Fiorina shot past Trump and Bush to a net score of 37 percent, but along the way earned the enmity of Trump, whom she whacked for his post-debate comments. Trump has made attacking Fiorina a standard part of his speeches and interviews since then, often complaining about the sound of her voice.

 

 â€œWeâ€™re not actually solving problems when we just hurl insults each otherâ€™s way,â€ Fiorina said in the interview. â€œI think we need a leader who will actually honor citizens by reengaging them in the political process and in their governmentâ€¦â€

 

 The poll shows Fiorina still has room to grow.

 

 After the debate, an all-time high of 51 percent of Republicans expressed familiarity with her name. That brings her near top-tier contender Scott Walker, who is still a relative unknown to 40 percent of his party. But she is still less known by 20 points than Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, 30 points less than Bush and 40 points less than Trump.

 

 â€It was my personal relationship with Jesus Christ that saved meâ€™ - In her interview, Fiorina also responded to those who have questioned her faith and resolve to fight Islamist militants because she once spoke in praise of the enlightenment of the medieval Ottoman Empire: â€œNo one needs to question or tell me about my faith. Iâ€™ve been through some hard times in my life. Iâ€™ve battled cancer. Weâ€™ve lost a child to the demons of addiction. So I understand in deeply personal terms, that it was my personal relationship with Jesus Christ that saved me, that saved my family. So itâ€™s unfortunate when people throw stones at anyone, but politics has sort of become that, hasnâ€™t it? And we have candidates who encourage it.â€

 

 SOUTHERN MAN: TRUMP HEADS TO MOBILE FOR MEGA RALLY

 In what is set to be a scorcher down South today, Donald Trump plans have his biggest rally yet. After moving venues to the University of South Alabamaâ€™s 40,000-seat stadium, Trump is looking to solidify summer support into something that will last through the winter.

 

 The Kingfish or the King? - AL.com: â€œâ€I had an older woman call me the other day asking how I can get tickets ... she didnâ€™t have Internet and she couldnâ€™t get tickets,â€™ [Jonathan Gray of Strategy Research] said. â€I asked her, â€Why do you want to go?â€™ I asked her, â€Are you backing Donald Trump?â€™ She said, â€I donâ€™t know think so.â€™ She said that she regretted â€all my life that she didnâ€™t see Elvisâ€™ and didnâ€™t want to regret the opportunity to see Donald Trump.â€™â€

 

 Trumped in their home states, except Walker, Kasich - A slew of recent polls in the home states of many 2016ers show they are losing ground to Donald Trump. In Florida, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio split potential voters to trail Trump by 4 points and 10 points, respectively. More significantly, Trump also maintains a major lead in Texas over home state guys Sen. Ted Cruz and former Gov. Rick Perry. Trump bests Cruz by 8 points and Perry by a dozen points, with 24 percent support - up from 2 percent two months ago.  But holding their ground are Scott Walker, who maintains a 25 percent to 9 percent advantage over Trump, and Gov. John Kasich, who tops a poll in his state, beating Trump by 6 points.

 

 Cruz shifting to meet Trump? - Wash Exâ€™s David Drucker takes a look at the differing immigration policies between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Is Cruz shifting his position to meet Trumpâ€™s hard line? Drucker writes, â€œâ€It shouldnâ€™t be surprising that thereâ€™s some commonality between Trumpâ€™s plan and Sen. Cruzâ€™s previously expressed positions,â€™ Cruz campaign senior spokesman Rick Tyler told the Washington Examiner in a telephone interview.â€

 

 Jeb cites Rubio, Cruz in birthright citizenship - National Review: â€œBush reminded voters that some popular Republicans have benefited from birthright citizenship. â€If people are here legally, they have a visa and they have a child whoâ€™s born here, I think that they ought to be American citizens,â€™ he said today in New Hampshire. â€People like Marco Rubio, by the way, thatâ€™s how he came. So to suggest that we make it impossible for a talented person like that not to be a candidate for president, or Ted Cruz? I think weâ€™re getting a little overboard here.â€™â€

 

 [Back off, eh - Cruzâ€™s campaign was quick to point out that the candidateâ€™s automatic American citizenship at birth in Canada derived from his motherâ€™s status as a natural-born citizen, not the provisions of the 14th Amendment.]

 

 Eurozone? - Federalist Ben Domenech asks whether Trumpâ€™s popularity reflects a turn toward European-style politics in America.

 Dubya raises cash for little bro - USA Today: â€œFormer president George W.

 WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEEâ€¦

 Patsy Clineâ€™s iconic recording of the song â€œCrazyâ€ was made in Nashville on this day in 1961. The song was written and first recorded by a 28-year-old Willie Nelson but came to national attention when rising star Cline did her rendition later that year. Cline did not like the original demo version and told her husband Charlie Dick, who brought home the recording for her, that she wasnâ€™t impressed. Cline decided to do the song, but due to a car crash months prior, could not record the song as Nelson intended. Her ribs had been damaged in the crash and she could not reach the high notes. After a multi-hour recording session, the country-pop tune was one of the biggest hits of the year. The album produced another enormous hit for Cline: â€œI Fall to Pieces.â€

 NEW DOUBTS ABOUT HILLARY EMAIL CLAIMS

 Reuters: â€œWhile the [State Department] is now stamping a few dozen of the publicly released emails as â€Classified,â€™ it stresses this is not evidence of rule-breaking. Those stamps are new, it says, and do not mean the information was classified when Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner in the 2016 presidential election, first sent or received it. But the details included in those â€Classifiedâ€™ stamps â€” which include a string of dates, letters and numbers describing the nature of the classification â€” appear to undermine this account, a Reuters examination of the emails and the relevant regulations has found. The new stamps indicate that some of Clinton's emails from her time as the nationâ€™s most senior diplomat are filled with a type of information the U.S. government and the departmentâ€™s own regulations automatically deems classified from the get-go â€” regardless of whether it is already marked that way or not.â€

The email list has also grown from a few thousand to more than 200,000 in recent weeks. â€Weâ€™ve seen a tremendous boost,â€™ said adviser Josh Alcorn, a former Biden presidential campaign staffer who was a close friend of Bidenâ€™s late son Beau.â€

 IRAN DEAL DOUBTS GROW

 Following U.N. agency and Obama administration pushback of an initial report by the APâ€¦â€œA draft document exclusively obtained by Fox News supports reports that Iran would play a major role in inspections at its controversial Parchin nuclear site, by providing U.N. inspectors with crucial materials. The so-called side deal, labeled â€Separate arrangement II,â€™ says Iran will â€provide to the [International Atomic Energy Agency]â€™ photos and videos of locations and environmental samples, â€taking into account military concerns.â€™â€¦The agreement also provides that the agency would ensure the â€technical authenticityâ€™ of activities -- in other words, ensuring nuclear work was not meant for weapons development -- but the IAEA would use Iran's â€authenticated equipment.â€™  This would be followed by a visit from the IAEA director general.â€

 

 [No sale - A CNN/ORC poll released Thursday shows 56 percent of Americans now say they think Congress should reject the deal with Iran -- up from 52 percent less than a month ago. In a recent Fox News poll respondents said they would reject the deal 58 percent to 31 percent if given the chance to vote on it.]

 

 Webb steps up opposition - Free Beacon: â€œDemocratic presidential candidate and former Sen. Jim Webb (D., Va.) said Friday that he opposed the Iran nuclear deal for, among other reasons, giving the rogue regime a greater balance of power in a fragile region. â€œThe danger in the Iran agreement is in what it does not address, other than nuclear issues, that allows Iran to continue to gain a greater balance of the power in a very fragile region,â€ Webb said on MSNBCâ€™s Morning Joe. â€œIt affects Israel. It affects the Sunni countries.â€

 

 â€œAnybody who trusts the Iranians really needs some time on the couch with someone to give them serious, serious therapy. Putting the Iranians in a position to self-inspectâ€¦this is like putting a mass murderer in charge of a gun store.â€ â€“ Former Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., from â€œFox and Friendsâ€

 

 BE THE BEAR

 Did you know that there are only two more Fridays left in the summer of 2015? Thatâ€™s a lot of pressure. You were supposed to do so many things this summer â€“ topiary gardens or extreme mountain biking or alpaca encounters or preserving your own organic gooseberries or whatever form of ambitious torture you devised for yourself three months ago. But you know who doesnâ€™t read stupid â€œsummer bucket listâ€ articles or worry about people silently judging them on social media? Bears. Bears donâ€™t care what you think about their summer plans. Bears donâ€™t check Pinterest. Bears are not worried about their fantasy football draft. Bears do not know what FOMO is. So please watch these five bear cubs and their mom have the best time ever in a New Jersey familyâ€™s above-ground swimming pool and just chillax.
