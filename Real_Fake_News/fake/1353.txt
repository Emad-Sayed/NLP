  Paul Joseph Watson Bureaucrat who said â€œstupidityâ€ of Americans helped get law passed doubles down 
Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber â€“ the bureaucrat who once bragged that the â€œstupidityâ€ of the American people was crucial for passing the health care law in the first place â€“ told CNN that the â€œfixâ€ for Obamacare was to impose a â€œlarger mandate penaltyâ€. CNNâ€™s CAROL COSTELLO: â€œSo letâ€™s talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. I just need you to be specific because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would one fix that would drive premiums down?â€ JONATHAN GRUBER: â€œLook, once again, thereâ€™s no sense it has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think, probably the most important things experts would agree on is we need a larger mandate penaltyâ€œâ€¦ Gruberâ€™s arrogance is incredible. Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree. Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. â€œObamaCare was never designed *not* to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs,â€ points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldnâ€™t come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people. A series of videos that emerged in 2014 featured Gruber admitting that Obamacare was deceptively crafted in order to fool â€œstupidâ€ Americans into not realizing that it would mean massive price hikes and that the lawâ€™s â€œlack of transparency (was) a huge political advantageâ€ in selling it.
