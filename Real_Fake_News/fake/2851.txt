OUT OF LEFT FIELD Gingrich slut-shames Megyn Kelly Adele M. Stan: Misogyny isn't just baked into the Trump brand, it is the Trump brand Published: 26 mins ago 
(American Prospect) â€” When, as a campaign surrogate and once-powerful white man, you answer allegations that your candidate may be a sexual predator with a sex-laced attack on your female interviewer, youâ€™re probably a misogynist. A desperate misogynist. 
Thatâ€™s what former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is looking like this morning. 
During a Tuesday discussion of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumpâ€™s sinking poll numbers, Gingrich accused Fox News Channel host Megyn Kelly of being â€œfascinated with sexâ€ when she dared to mention that Trumpâ€™s fortunes began falling after the now infamous Access Hollywood video, featuring Trump boasting about his self-proclaimed prerogative to sexually assault women, became public on October 7, and nearly a dozen women came forward to allege that Trump had either assaulted them or otherwise taken liberties with their bodies.
