Several top journalists and TV news anchors RSVPed â€œyesâ€ to attend a private, off-the-record gathering at the New York home of Joel Benenson, the chief campaign strategist for Hillary Clinton, two days before she announced her candidacy in 2015, according to emails Wikileaks has published from John Podesta â€™s purported accounts. 
The guest list for an earlier event at the home of John Podesta was limited to reporters who were expected to cover Clinton on the campaign trail. 
The email thread starts with Jesse Ferguson, the campaignâ€™s Deputy National Press Secretary and Senior Spokesman, describing the venues and target audience of each gathering: 
We wanted to make sure everyone on this email had the latest information on the two upcoming dinners with reporters. Both are off-the-record. 
1) Thursday night, April 9th at 7:00p.m. Dinner at the Home of John Podestaâ€¦ This will be with about 20 reporters who will closely cover the campaign (aka the bus). 
2) Friday night, April 10th at 6:30p.m. Cocktails and Hors Dâ€™oeuvre at the Home of Joel Benensonâ€¦ This is with a broader universe of New York reporters. 
The â€œbroader universe of New York reportersâ€ includes several top news anchors for network and cable channels, many of whom are listed as a â€œyesâ€ for the appearance: 
From ABC: Cecilia Vega, David Muir, Diane Sawyer (who could only stay for 30 minutes), and George Stephanopoulos. 
From CBS News: Norah Oâ€™Donnell. 
From CNN: Brianna Keilar, Gloria Borger, John Berman, and Kate Bolduan. 
From MSNBC: Alex Wagner and Rachel Maddow (â€œTRYINGâ€). 
From NBC: Savannah Guthrie. 
â€œYesâ€ respondent George Stephanopoulos worked for Bill Clintonâ€™s presidential campaign and was a Senior Adviser to the President during Clintonâ€™s first White House term. Stephanopoulos does not disclose this fact when reporting on the 2016 Clinton campaign for ABC News. 
The nascent Clinton campaign invited Jeff Zucker and Phil Griffin, the presidents of CNN and MSNBC, respectively. Zucker declined while Griffin RSVPed â€œyes.â€ CNBCâ€™s John Harwood 
Wikileaksâ€™ release of emails from the Democratic National Committee showed then-DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz scheduled or attempted to schedule private meetings with both executives.Other â€œyesâ€ RSVPs come from journalists who have been sighted in the Wikileaks Podesta emails, outing them as friendly or fawning towards Hillaryâ€™s campaign. 
CNBCâ€™s John Harwood, who was also a moderator for a 2015 presidential debate, emailed Podesta frequently , practically begging for approval and access . Politicoâ€™s Glenn Thrush 
Politicoâ€™s Glenn Thrush also emailed Podesta periodically. On Monday, a newly-released email revealed a particularly humiliating incident where Thrush sent Podesta a passage from an upcoming article for his personal approval. 
â€œBecause I have become a hack I will send u the whole section that pertains to u,â€ Thrush wrote. â€œPlease donâ€™t share or tell anyone I did thisâ€¦ Tell me if I fucked up anything.â€ 
Sandra Sobieraj Westfall, Washington Bureau Chief at PEOPLE magazine, boasted two days after this confab that stories on Clintonâ€™s campaign were generating â€œabsolutely off the chartsâ€ traffic and asked for â€œcolor you can whisper on backgroundâ€ about what Hillary was up to.
