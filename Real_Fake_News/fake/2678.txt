Renaissance Jackson, the organization that briefly won the mayorâ€™s office in predominantly Black Jackson, Mississippi, has launched a campaign to purchase a coding and programming capacity and a 3-D fabrication facility. They call it â€œFab Lab.â€ This technology, â€œif it is democratically controlled, could actually serve humanity,â€ said Cooperation Jackson spokesman Kali Akuno . These kinds of projects are crucial, â€œfirst and foremost, to satisfy some of the basic needs of our community, and -- on a deeper level -- to really put this means of production directly in our communityâ€™s hands.â€ High tech is â€œone of these areas of the so-called â€digital divideâ€™ that Black people have been sorely and strategically absent from,â€ said Akuno. â€œSo, we are doing it for ourselves.â€ Obamacare â€œImploding and Beyond Repairâ€ 
The current wave of insurance rate hikes and medical service cutbacks is the predictable result of an Affordable Care Act (ACA) that â€œwas pretty much a gift to the health insurance industryâ€ when Congress passed it, in 2010, said Dr. John Geyman , professor emeritus of family medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine, in Seattle. ACA â€œwas never designed for affordability -- itâ€™s a misnomer in the name of the bill,â€ he said. Obamacare is â€œimploding and beyond repair,â€ and unsustainable. â€œTweeks cannot work in the long term. The main fight should be for what will save money and give universal coverage to everyone: namely, single payer national health insurance.â€ Dr. Geyman said single payer healthcare could save $500 billion a year -- about the same as the entire U.S. â€œdefenseâ€ budget. The Fight for Education for Liberation in Detroit 
At a â€œCommunity Conversation on the Crisis in the Schools,â€ Detroit activists, educators and parents gathered to address the question: â€œWho Created the School Crisis, and How are We Responding to it?â€ Among those wrestling with the issue was Dr. Thomas Pedroni , professor of Curriculum Studies at Wayne State University. He said the decline began with the state takeover of schools in the 1990s, and worsened dramatically after the imposition of state-appointed â€œemergency managers.â€ â€œSchool could be one of the most meaningful places for our communities, but instead, itâ€™s deadened,â€ Dr. Pedroni told the crowd at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. â€œBut, weâ€™re going to fight to get back to the place where we have culturally relevant curriculum, not just producing a test score but to develop people who are self-empowered and who know how to fight for their community.â€ Venezuela Weathering Financial Storm, Despite Disinformation Campaign 
â€œI challenge you to find one item of news that is positive to Venezuela in these last 16 or 17 years,â€ said Maria Paez Victor , a Venezuelan-born sociologist living in Toronto, Canada, and author of an article titled â€œHating Venezuela.â€ Ms. Victor said the United States and its rightwing allies in Venezuela have kept up a non-stop disinformation campaign ever since the late Hugo Chavez and his Socialist Party were democratically elected in 1998. A crisis triggered by the collapse of world oil prices allowed the opposition to capture the legislature, last year, but Victor says the government is coping. â€œVenezuela has managed to weather a terrible financial situation, but this is bad news for corporate capitalism and for the United States, because they want Venezuela to be controlled by their lackies.â€ Black Agenda Radio on the Progressive Radio Network is hosted by Glen Ford and Nellie Bailey.
