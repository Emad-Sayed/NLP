Hipster dog only likes 80s dog food that you canâ€™t get any more 07-11-16 A DOG hipster will only eat an obscure type of vintage dog food that he enjoys in a semi-ironic way. Labrador Wayne Hayes refuses to eat normal dog biscuits, preferring a discontinued American 80s brand of dog food called Chunkiez that his owners have to buy off the internet at vast expense. Hayes said: â€œIâ€™m all about Chunkiez Beefy Mix because the box they come in has such a cool design aesthetic. It just speaks to my vibe. â€œI realise itâ€™s £17 a box because they stopped making it in 1984 and thereâ€™s only one warehouse in Canada that has stock, but like everything in my life itâ€™s paid for by my parents.â€ Hayes, who also claims to like postmen and fireworks, reckons he is friends with all the working class bull terriers at his local park even though they growl at him whenever he approaches.
