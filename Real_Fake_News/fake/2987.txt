Warning or threat? Hillary hints at second civil war if Trump wins 11/02/2016 
While speaking to supporters in Cincinnati on Monday, Democrat Hillary Clinton hinted at a second civil war if GOP nominee Donald Trump wins, Breitbart.com reported.

â€œHe has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart,â€ Clinton said to supporters in Cincinnati, Ohio on Halloween. 
Clinton specifically referred to the Civil War, suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from Donald Trump. 
â€œAbraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges â€“ the challenge posed by slavery â€“ and we fought a civil war,â€ she said. 
She warned voters that it was time for the country to take the divisions in the country seriously. 
â€œBut we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together,â€ she added, failing to admit that her side is the one that has divided America by race, class and gender. 
She also claimed that Trump would start a nuclear war if a foreign leader got under his skin. 
â€œI know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I donâ€™t think so,â€ she said at a rally in Kent, Ohio, earlier in the day. 
A post at Barracuda Brigade observed: 
Liberals especially the Clinton are always projecting. Anything that they accuse the other side of is what they are doing. She suggests that her message is one of â€œhope and changeâ€ when in fact it is just more of the same. 
Moreover, Trump has spent a great deal of time talking about policies and issues while Clinton & Co. have done absolutely nothing but engage in fear-mongering and fingerpointing. 
Still, we have to ask â€” was Clintonâ€™s â€œhintâ€ a â€œwarningâ€ or a â€œthreat?â€
