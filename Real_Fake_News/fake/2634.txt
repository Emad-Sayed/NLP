New emails show Huma scheming for Hillary 
Assange promises that WikiLeaks will release proof that Hillary has rigged the elections. 
Yesterday, WikiLeaks sent out an alarming tweet that â€œHillary Clinton strategist Bob Beckel called for WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange to be assassinatedâ€: 
The tweet contains a video snippet of Beckel on FoxNews, saying: 
â€œThe way to deal with this is pretty simple â€” you get Special Ops (Operations) forces. I mean, a dead man canâ€™t leak stuff. This guyâ€™s [Assange] a traitor, treasonous, and and heâ€™s broken every law of the United States. The guy ought to be â€” and Iâ€™m not for the death penalty, so if Iâ€™m not for the death penalty, the only way to do it is illegally shoot the son of a bitch .â€ 
Blog and news sites, including big names like ZeroHedge and Pamela Geller , are reporting Beckelâ€™s vile remarks as contemporaneous, in the context of WikiLeaksâ€™ current expos©s of Hillary and the DNC. 
Not so. 
Beckel actually made those remarks 5 years ago in December 2011. Hereâ€™s a longer FoxNews video, wherein Beckel was part of a panel discussing how the U.S. should deal with Assange and WikiLeaks for their release of the State Departmentâ€™s diplomatic cables. Beckelâ€™s â€œshoot the son of a bitchâ€ remarks begin at the 0:57 mark: 
That it was 5 years ago that Beckel had called for assassinating Julian Assange doesnâ€™t make it less reprehensible. Itâ€™s also ridiculous for Beckel to call Assange â€œa traitorâ€ and â€œtreasonous,â€ because Assange is Australian, not a U.S. citizen. 
So who is Bob Beckel? 
According to Wikipedia , 67-year-old Bob Beckel is a political analyst-pundit who began his professional life as a Democratic administration official and Democratic Party operative. He was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State (1977) and Special Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs (1978) in the Carter administration; the campaign manager for Walter Mondaleâ€™s 1984 presidential campaign; founder of the consulting & lobbying firm Bob Beckel & Associates (1984); campaign manager of a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate in Idaho (2002); USA Today columnist (2005-2015); FoxNews â€œ token angry liberal â€ co-host (2011-2015); and since October 2015, CNN commentator on the 2016 election. 
Wikipedia makes no mention of Beckel being a Hillary Clinton strategist, nor have I found confirmation that he is a Hillary strategist, other than what the WikiLeaks tweet claims. But all that doesnâ€™t mean he isnâ€™t a Hillary Clinton strategist, given Beckelâ€™s history as a Democratic Party operative. 
There must be a reason why WikiLeaks sent out its tweet of Beckelâ€™s 5-year-old call to assassinate Assange. Perhaps Assange has received death threats and does not want the same fate that befell DNC staffer and WikiLeaks informant Seth Rich. (See â€œ WikiLeaks â€™ Julian Assange: murdered DNC staffer was source of leaked DNC emails â€)
