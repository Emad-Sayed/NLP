The DNC is suing the Republican National Committee due to Donald Trumpâ€™s claims that Hillary Clinton is committing election fraud.

The suit was filed in a U.S. District Court in New Jersey and aims to silence Trumpâ€™s claim that the election is rigged, which the DNC are particularly sensitive about. The DNC alleges that the RNC has not done enough to reprimand Trump for claiming that the election is rigged, and seeks to have the court hold the committee in civil contempt as well as levy sanctions.
The DNC claims that because the RNC has done â€œballot securityâ€ work, they are agreeing with Trump that the election is rigged. Marc Elias, Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign counsel, claims that there is also a racial element to Trumpâ€™s claims of voter fraud.
â€œTrump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be â€riggedâ€™ based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in â€certain areasâ€™ or â€certain sectionsâ€™ of key states,â€ the Democratic attorneys, including Hillary Clinton campaign counsel Marc Elias, wrote.
â€œUnsurprisingly, those â€certain areasâ€™ are exclusively communities in which large minority voting populations reside.â€ Election Day is in 13 days.
