Did Anthony Weiner say these things as part a deal to save himself? Anthony Weiner has spoken! One year ago, we all that that Donald Trump was just being funny, just being Trump, when he said that Hillary Clinton was showing poor judgement in letting Huma Abedin, wife of â€œperf sleazeâ€ Anthony Weiner have access to government information. Trump called the couple a security risk, but again, we thought he was just making fun of them. As it turns out, Donald Trumpâ€™s words were eerily prophetic. Unless you have been hiding under a rock, you have heard by now that the FBI is reopening the investigation of Hillary Clintonâ€™s email problems after finding evidence on devices at Anthony Weinerâ€™s home. Earlier, we reported that FBI Director James Comey had tricked Obamaâ€™s Department of Justice and the Clintons in sending the investigation announcement letter to Congress. Some believe that Comey was attempting to force the DOJ to issue a warrant so that his agents can start reading the 10,000+ emails on Weinerâ€™s device. 
Here Is How FBI Director Comey BAMBOOZLED The DOJ, CONGRESS, And The CLINTONS All At Once 
Now, Anthony Weiner has spoken and he may have made Comeyâ€™s job even easier, while completely bypassing the Department of Justice altogether. 
According to reports, Weiner has given permission for the FBI to access all of the information on his electronic devices, including his wifi router. . @BretBaier emails Chris Wallace while heâ€™s on air: Weiner has given FBI permission to search computer so no warrant needed. @FoxNewsSunday

In essence, Weiner is singing like a bird, and the FBI can conduct a thorough review of the emails in question. If there is criminality found on Weinerâ€™s devices, they have a shot at it. 
Is there anything that the Department of Justice or the Clintons can do? 
Time will tell, but many believe that WikiLeaks and others are about to drop more incriminating evidence on Hillary later this week. 
Comey may have saved himself. Weiner may be trying to cut a plea deal to save himself. 
Hang on, as this ride is still picking up steam! Related Items
