Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/renowned-harvard-psychologist-says-adhd.html Viewed by academics as one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century, Jerome Kagan ranked above Carl Jung (the founder of analytical psychology) and Ivan Pavlov (who discovered the Pavlovian reflex) in a 2002 American Psychological Association ranking of the eminent psychologists. He is well-known for his pioneering work in developmental psychology at Harvard University, where he has spent decades documenting how babies and small children grow, and is an exceptional and highly-regarded researcher.So it may be surprising to learn that he believes the diagnosis of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is an invention â€” and only benefits the pharmaceutical industry and psychiatrists. Mislabeling Mental Illness â€œThat is the history of humanity: Those in authority believe theyâ€™re doing the right thing, and they harm those who have no power,â€ says Jerome Kagan.In an interview with Spiegel, Kagan addressed the skyrocketing rates of ADHD in America , which he attributes to â€œfuzzy diagnostic practices.â€ He illustrated his point with the following example:Say fifty years ago you have a 7-year-old who is bored in school and exhibits disruptive behavior. Back then, he would be labeled as lazy. But today, that same child is said to suffer from ADHD . Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve seen such a dramatic increase in the disorder.Every child who is having problems in school is sent to see a pediatrician, who then claims itâ€™s ADHD and prescribes Ritalin . â€œIn fact, 90 percent of these 5.4 million kids donâ€™t have an abnormal dopamine metabolism. The problem is, if a drug is available to doctors, theyâ€™ll make the corresponding diagnosis,â€ he said.â€œWe could get philosophical and ask ourselves: â€œWhat does mental illness mean?â€ If you do interviews with children and adolescents aged 12 to 19, then 40 percent can be categorized as anxious or depressed. â€œBut if you take a closer look and ask how many of them are seriously impaired by this, the number shrinks to 8 percent. Describing every child who is depressed or anxious as being mentally ill is ridiculous. â€œAdolescents are anxious, thatâ€™s normal. They donâ€™t know what college to go to. Their boyfriend or girlfriend just stood them up. Being sad or anxious is just as much a part of life as anger or sexual frustration,â€ Kagan told Spiegel.What are the implications for the millions of American children who are inaccurately diagnosed as mentally ill? Kagan believes itâ€™s devastating because they think there is something fundamentally wrong with them. Heâ€™s not the only psychologist to raise the alarm about this trend, but Kagan and others feel theyâ€™re up against â€œan enormously powerful alliance: pharmaceutical companies that are making billions , and a profession that is self-interested.â€Kagan himself suffered from inner restlessness and stuttering as a child, but his mother told him: â€œThereâ€™s nothing wrong with you. Your mind is working faster than your tongue.â€He thought at the time: â€œGee, thatâ€™s great, Iâ€™m only stuttering because Iâ€™m so smart.â€ If he had been born in the present era, he most likely would have been classified as mentally ill.ADHD isnâ€™t the only mental illness epidemic among children that worries Kagan, depression is another. In 1987, about one in 400 American teenagers was using an antidepressant. By 2002, the numbers leaped to one in 40. He feels itâ€™s another overused diagnosis, simply because the pills are available. Instead of immediately resorting to pharmaceutical drugs, he thinks doctors should take more time with the child to find out why they arenâ€™t as cheerful, for instance. At the very least, a few tests should be carried out â€” and an EEG for certain, especially since studies have shown that people who have heightened activity in the right frontal lobe respond poorly to antidepressants.Kagan remembers going into a textbook-type depression after a major research project he was involved with failed. He had insomnia and met all the other clinical criteria for depression. But since he knew what the cause was, he didnâ€™t seek professional help. After six months, the depression was gone. Under normal circumstances, he would have been diagnosed as mentally ill by a psychiatrist and put on medication.
