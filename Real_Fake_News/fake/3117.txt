You have about a year to get ready for the next leg of the collapseâ€¦ 

From Mac Slavo, SHTFPlan : 
It is no longer a question of whether or not financial markets and the U.S. economy will collapse. That, according to a host of experts, both mainstream and alternative, is a given. 
The only question now is â€œwhenâ€ that moment will come. 
According to Christine Hughes, chief investment strategist at Otterwood Capital, it will be very soon. Basing her assessment on historically dead-on yield curve analysis, Hughes says in her latest update to clients that weâ€™re looking at a maximum breaking point of 2020, but that some time in the next 12 â€“ 15 months is the more likely scenario, which pegs the next crisis right at the beginning of 2018 . 
First, the chart, which has been near perfect in its accuracy thus far and shows just how rapidly the yield curve has collapsed in the last 12 months: 
Hughes explains what it means for you and why you can expect 2018 to be the year of reckoning: 
As the bond market sees a recession slower growth means lower interest rates and it [the yield curve] collapses. So letâ€™s assume weâ€™re like every other time in history and that happens. Then it moves forward to 2018â€¦ 
So, 2018, according to the yield curve, is pretty much the last gasp we have for this economic cycle. Weâ€™re closing in on 2016 nowâ€¦ we basically have a yearâ€¦ maybe a year to 15 months before we have the next crisis on our hands. 
So if you are levered personally or corporatelyâ€¦ if a lot of your assets are in illiquid stuffâ€¦ the Canadian housing market comes to mindâ€¦ You might want to think about existing and liquefying yourself.

Wolf Richter of Wolf Street explains why the Treasury Yield Curve is so important: 
Since early July, the 30-year US Treasury Bond Price Index has plunged 8.3%. Itâ€™s now called â€œthe routâ€ in longer-dated government bonds. One of the specters is rising inflation at a time of ultra-low yields. 
What has become the number one predictor of a bear market in stocks over the past many decades? The US Treasury yield curve. It drives bank lending â€“ which can strangle the economy. But this time, the risks are much higher, and the potential economic consequences steeper. 
We know it is only a matter of time at this point. 
Greg Mannarino of Traders Choice has made similar warnings, noting that the bond markets are signaling a massive crash ahead. And when that crash finally takes place the fall out after the debt bubble bursts, according to Mannarino, could lead to extremely serious consequences: 
So, when the debt bubble bursts weâ€™re going to get a correction in population. Itâ€™s a mathematical certainty. 
Millions upon millions of people are going to die on a world-wide scale when the debt bubble bursts. And Iâ€™m saying when not ifâ€¦ 
â€¦ 
When resources become more and more scarce weâ€™re going to see countries at war with each other. People will be scramblingâ€¦ in a worst case scenarioâ€¦ doing everything that they can to surviveâ€¦ to provide for their family and for themselves. 
Thereâ€™s no way out of it.

If Mannarino and Hughes are right, you have about a year to get ready for the next leg of the collapse .
