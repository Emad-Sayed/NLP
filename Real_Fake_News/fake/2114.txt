WOW! What Josh Earnest admitted about Obamacare is stunning (because itâ€™s true) Posted at 1:53 pm on October 27, 2016 by Doug P. 
As weâ€™ve reported and too many Americans have noticed, the ironically named â€œAffordableâ€ Care Act has caused premiums and deductibles to go through the roof . White House Spokesman Josh Earnest actually conformed to reality: . @PressSec concedes middle-class families not eligible for tax credits are being hit by higher premiums on ObamaCare. .
