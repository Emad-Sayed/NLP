Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) ignited a political firestorm Thursday night after he randomly brought up his Democratic rivalâ€™s heritage after she touted her military experience during a debate. 
Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who is of mixed Thai and American descent, cited her military service as well as her familyâ€™s when making the case against rushing into war. 
â€œIâ€™m a daughter of the American Revolution. Iâ€™ve bled for this nation. But I still want to be there in the Senate when the drums of war sound,â€œ she said. â€Because people are quick to sound the drums of war and I want to be there to say, â€This is what it costs, this is what youâ€™re asking us to doâ€™. Letâ€™s make sure the American people understand what we are engaging in.â€ 
When given a chance to respond, Kirk remarked, â€œI had forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.â€ Illinois Senator Mark Kirk Made A Racist Remark About His Opponentâ€™s Heritage https://t.co/MmS5HnGEG7 pic.twitter.com/Q1bFnqviAG

No one, including the debate moderator, quite knew how to react. After a brief awkward silence, the moderator moved the discussion forward. Critics immediately branded the comment as â€œracistâ€ and distasteful. 
Duckworth lost both of her legs while serving as a pilot in the Army during the Iraq war. Her father also served in the U.S.army and her familyâ€™s military service goes all the way back to the Revolutionary War, BuzzFeed reported .

Duckworth responded on Twitter with an indisputable message. My mom is an immigrant and my dad and his family have served this nation in uniform since the Revolution #ILSEN pic.twitter.com/ehEBHswFMs â€” Tammy Duckworth (@TammyforIL) October 28, 2016 
Kirkâ€™s campaign later issued a statement addressing the controversy: 
â€œSenator Kirk has consistently called Rep. Duckworth a war hero and honors her familyâ€™s service to this country. But thatâ€™s not what this debate was about. Rep. Duckworth lied about her legal troubles, was unable to defend her failures at the VA and then falsely attacked Senator Kirk over his record on supporting gay rights.â€ 
But at that point, the damage was already done.
