In case you didnâ€™t already know the glaringly obvious, MSNBC is widely considered to be one of the most liberal cable news channels of all the mainstream media. Now, in a stunning segment on his show, MSNBC host Chris Matthews basically endorses Donald Trump. Hillary must be feeling pretty crappy about herself because this latest scandal appears to have been pushed Matthews onto the Trump train. A liberal. Thatâ€™s sad Hillary. 
Matthews reviews a string of Obamaâ€™s failures, then goes on to say that if you like them, vote for Hillary. If you want to change those failures, the only option is to vote for Trump. This is HUGE! 
You know you are on the losing end when staunch Democrats even hate you. 
He even stated that we have the chance to change the status quo unless weâ€™ve become too â€œdaintyâ€ to do that. I seriously canâ€™t believe I heard that from Chris Matthews on MSNBC! Related Items
