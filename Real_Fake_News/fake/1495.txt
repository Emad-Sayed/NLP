You've all heard by now that Donald Trump thinks Hillary Clinton is trying to rig the campaign, including the idea that she's trying to suppress his voters. 
Now Bloomberg Businessweek has a major new story out on his campaign, including a few fascinating revelations: 
â€œNate Silverâ€™s results have been similar to ours....except they lag by a week or two because heâ€™s relying on public polls.â€ 
The campaign holds rallies in non-traditional states like New Hampshire and Maine because data shows that's where the most persuadable voters can be found. 
You meet Brad Parscale, Trump's main digital guy, who has quite a background. Join me on @thedonaldreddit Reddit AMA right now! https://t.co/tpyfSB0M75 â€” Brad Parscale (@parscale) October 25, 2016 
Most importantly, the story also presents another side of the Trump campaign, an active effort to persuade Democrats not to vote. It concentrates on three key groups. 1) White Liberals 
Trumpâ€™s invocation at the debate of Clintonâ€™s WikiLeaks e-mails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. 2) Young Women 
The parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. 3) African-Americans 
Her 1996 suggestion that some African American males are â€œsuper predatorsâ€ is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the pollsâ€”particularly in Florida. 
That strategy in action: 
On Oct. 24, Trumpâ€™s team began placing spots on select African American radio stations. In San Antonio, a young staffer showed off a South Park-style animation heâ€™d created of Clinton delivering the â€œsuper predatorâ€ line (using audio from her original 1996 sound bite), as cartoon text popped up around her: â€œHillary Thinks African Americans are Super Predators.â€ 
The animation will be delivered to certain African American voters through Facebook â€œdark postsâ€â€”nonpublic posts whose viewership the campaign controls so that, as Parscale puts it, â€œonly the people we want to see it, see it.â€ The aim is to depress Clintonâ€™s vote total. â€œWe know because weâ€™ve modeled this,â€ says the official. â€œIt will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out.â€ 
Early voting shows that the efforts to decrease turnout may not be working according to the Trump campaign's plan, but it's rare for a campaign to so openly boast of an effort to get people not to vote.
