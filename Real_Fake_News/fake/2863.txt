Patty Sanchez, 51, used to eat 13,000 calories a day and weigh more than 320 kilograms as she tried to satisfy boyfriend's fantasies

Patty weighed more than 320 kilograms when she split from her feeder boyfriend, who was constantly encouraging and enabling her weight gain. 

Patty Sanchez has gone from 320 kilograms to 215 kilograms after years of constant eating with the encouragement of her ex-boyfriend and online fat fetishists. 

Having purposefully consumed up to 13,000 calories per day for years on end, it is a minor miracle in itself that Patty has made it to 51 and is in position to change her lifestyle. 

After splitting from her boyfriend of ten years, Patty soon realized that she had become very isolated and vulnerable due to her size.


The mother-of-four has spoken out about the positive effect weight loss has had on both her personal and family life, also allowing her to undertake a wide range of everyday tasks previously impossible to her. 
"I was tremendous â€“ and I was dying a slow death.I realized that the feeding relationship I was in and the squashing was benefiting others, but it wasnâ€™t for me. The weight loss had a lot to do with my break up with my ex â€“ I was being served every meal daily, and when we broke up I had to take care of myself.I never feared death before â€“ it was something I never thought about when I was getting bigger and bigger. But when I reached my lowest and couldnâ€™t walk to the bathroom without getting winded I was worried I wouldnâ€™t be there for my kids and grand kids. My struggles didnâ€™t fully surface until I was single and had no one to help me and couldnâ€™t cook, bathe, or leave the house â€“ it was very lonely,â€ she said in an interview. Today, with the help of her sons, Patty eats 3,000 calories a day and is more mobile. 

She said: â€œI stay away from fast food and eat more vegetables, fruits and poultry. Now I can do things that people take for granted that I couldnâ€™t do - like walk, bathe, and paint my toenails which I couldn't reach for years." 


â€œMy children are very proud of me for changing my life around - we have a better relationship now," she added.
