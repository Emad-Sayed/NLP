U-Mâ€™s New â€Chief Diversity Officerâ€™ Will Collect $385,000 per Year Derek Draplin, Michigan Capitol Confidential, October 28, 2016 
The University of Michiganâ€™s new chief diversity officer will collect $385,000 a year under his various job titles, including a new one created by a recently revealed $85 million, five-year U-M diversity plan . 
Robert Sellersâ€™ appointment to a new position called â€œvice provost for equity and inclusion and chief diversity officerâ€ (VPEI-CDO) was approved Oct. 20 by the universityâ€™s governing board. Sellers previously served as â€œvice provost for equity and inclusion,â€ and is also listed as a professor of both psychology and education. In 2014-15 Sellers was paid $347,295 in his capacity as vice provost, a position created in 2014. 
President Mark Schlissel nominated Sellers for the job several weeks ago. The new full-time administrative position â€œwill serve as a leadership voice on diversity, equity and inclusion for the entire university.â€ 
The diversity plan Sellers will oversee will spend $17 million a year over the next five years. It seeks to â€œrecruit, retain and develop a diverse university communityâ€ and â€œsupport innovation and inclusive scholarship and teachingâ€ through a number of new and expanded programs. 
The $85 million plan is in addition to the $40 million a year the university already spends promoting diversity.
