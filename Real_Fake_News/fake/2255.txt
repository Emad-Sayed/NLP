WATCH and laugh: possibly the BEST vine of Hillary from the 2016 campaign â€¦ so far Posted at 4:23 pm on October 27, 2016 by Sam J. 
Several weeks back, Twitter was hee-hawâ€™ing over the short â€œvineâ€ of Hillary saying over and over and over again, â€œWhy am I not 50 points ahead?!â€ 
This vine takes it one step further, and the payoff is awesome.
