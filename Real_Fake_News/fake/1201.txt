 
In the schoolyard of American politics, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stood tall Tuesday as he fired back at Vice President Joe Biden for a slam Biden sent his way last week.
â€œThe press always asks me: Donâ€™t I wish I were debating him? No, I wish we were in high school â€” I could take him behind the gym. Thatâ€™s what I wish,â€ Biden said last week while attacking him for comments that surfaced from Trumpâ€™s past.
Trump commented on that remark Tuesday during a rally in Tallahassee, Fla.

â€œ Iâ€™d love that . Iâ€™d love that,â€ Trump added. â€œMr. Tough Guy. Heâ€™s Mr. Tough Guy. You know, heâ€™s Mr. Tough Guy, when heâ€™s standing behind a microphone by himself.â€
 
Trump seemed to relish the thought.
â€œSome things in life you could really love doing,â€ Trump said.
I'm trying to envision something more fitting than this election actually ending in a Biden-Trump fist fight and i cannot

â€œBy the way, if I said that, theyâ€™d say, â€Heâ€™s violent. How could he have done that?'â€ Trump said.
Trump, who according to one recent poll has a narrow lead in Florida, told supporters that he was confident of victory .
â€œIn 14 days we are going to win the state of Florida and we are going to win back the White House,â€ he declared.
â€œWe have a thing going on that they have never seen before. It is a movement. They have never seen anything like it before. We are going to win and we are going to bring back a lot of good things including common sense to the White House,â€ Trump added.
â€œWe have the power in our hands,â€ he said. â€œIn just 14 days â€“ 14 days? Can you believe this? I started, it was a year and a half. Now weâ€™re down to 14 days.â€
â€œWe had unbelievably tough, nasty primaries. Weâ€™re proud to say they were the most difficult and toughest primaries they say in the history of politics. And now we have a nasty, nasty election. But we have the facts on our side,â€ he added.
