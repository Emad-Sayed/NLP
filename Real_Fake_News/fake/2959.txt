DOJ Tried Repeatedly To Kill FBIâ€™s Clinton Foundation Investigation 11/01/2016 
THE DAILY CALLER 
Senior-level Justice Department officials pushed back heavily on an ongoing FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation, according to a bombshell report from The Wall Street Journal. 
The newspaper laid out numerous examples, based on law enforcement sources, of senior DOJ officials intervening to quash the probe. 
Prosecutors with the U.S. attorneys office in the Eastern District of New York â€” which Loretta Lynch led before taking over as attorney general last year â€” refused to allow FBI investigators probing the Clinton family charity to review emails found on devices turned over this year by two of Clintonâ€™s lawyers during the separate investigation into the mishandling of classified information on Clintonâ€™s private email system. 
The rationale, according to The Journal , was that the devices were covered by partial immunity and limited-use agreements that the Clinton lawyers â€” Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson â€” agreed to with the DOJ. Information recovered from the laptops could only be used in the email investigation and not in others. 
As part of the immunity agreement, the FBI and Justice Department agreed to destroy Millsâ€™ and Samuelsonâ€™s devices, a revelation that sparked outrage from congressional Republicans when it was announced earlier this month. 
The Journalâ€™s report largely confirms reporting in August from The Daily Caller News Foundationâ€™s Richard Pollock that the FBI and several U.S. attorneys offices were conducting an unorthodox, joint investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

CNN reported at around the same time that a Clinton Foundation probe was tabled by the Justice Department. Pollockâ€™s report and the new piece from The Journal undermine CNNâ€™s reporting. 
While the investigation has gone forward, the Justice Department has stymied the investigation at several turns, according to The Journal. 
The DOJ refused to grant the FBI the power to issue subpoenas or conduct formal interviews. It also refused to convene a grand jury to weigh evidence in the case. 
More pushback occurred in August, when a senior DOJ official contacted the FBIâ€™s deputy director, Andrew McCabe, to voice his displeasure that New York field office agents were continuing the investigation even though the DOJ had declined to provide investigative support. 
The official was â€œvery pissed offâ€ that the FBI was continuing its efforts, according to The Journal. 
The call occurred on Aug. 12, a day after CNN reported details of FBI-DOJ discord over whether to investigate the Clinton Foundation. It was also a day after Pollock reported that an investigation was underway. 
McCabe figures prominently in The Journalâ€™s reporting and in the overlapping Clintonworld investigations. 
It was revealed last week that McCabeâ€™s wife, Jill, received nearly $470,000 in contributions to a Virginia state senate campaign last year from Gov. Terry McAuliffeâ€™s super PAC. 
McAuliffe is a close Clinton ally and is the subject of a separate FBI investigation. 
According to The Journal, McCabe refocused the Clinton Foundation investigation a week after FBI director James Comey announced in early July that he would recommend to the Justice Department that charges not be filed against Clinton for mishandling classified information in her emails. 
The charity probe would be led by the FBIâ€™s New York office with help from the Little Rock office, according to The Journal. FBI field offices in Los Angeles and Washington were also involved in the Clinton Foundation investigation. 
The Los Angeles office subpoenaed bank records related to the Clinton Foundation after obtaining information during a separate public corruption case. The office in Washington was investigating McAuliffeâ€™s financial relationships from before he joined the Clinton Foundation as a board member. 
After Comeyâ€™s announcement on the Clinton email investigation in July, McCabe decided that the Washington FBI office would focus on the separate McAuliffe matter. He recused himself from that investigation because of the donations his wife received from McAuliffeâ€™s super PAC in 2015. 
While the FBI has insisted that McCabe is not compromised in any of the investigations â€” the email probe, the Clinton Foundation, or the McAuliffe matter â€” The Journal reports that some agents believe he has issued â€œstand downâ€ orders in the Clinton Foundation inquiry.

That claim came from FBI agents lower on the chain of command from senior-level officials. Still other sources denied that McCabe issued a â€œstand downâ€ order. They asserted that McCabe ordered investigators to continue on their investigative path. 
McCabeâ€™s Aug. 12 phone conversation with the senior DOJ official would seem to suggest that he supported the investigation. 
â€œAre you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?â€ McCabe asked the DOJ official, according to a Journal source who was familiar with the conversation. 
â€œOf course not,â€ the official reportedly said, after a brief pause. 
The new report also details a presentation that FBI officials made to the Justice Department in February to lay out the case against the Clinton Foundation. 
Some of the Journalâ€™s sources said that the DOJâ€™s career public integrity prosecutors did not believe that the case was strong. 
â€œOthers said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case,â€ The Journal reported. 
DOJ officials told the FBI at the meeting additional investigative tools â€” subpoenas, interviews or a grand jury â€” would not be authorized.
