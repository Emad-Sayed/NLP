Homeless man looking a bit down today for some reason 27-10-16 A HOMELESS man who is usually upbeat seems a bit down today and no oneâ€™s quite sure why. Bill McKay, 56, usually sings Born in the USA while greeting passers-by but locals claim he doesnâ€™t quite seem his usual jolly self. Local Barista, Julian Cook said, â€œHeâ€™s usually so full of life. Dancing about the place, proposing to every girl who walks past him and then laughing when they walk off. But today heâ€™s just sat there looking bloody depressed. â€œI wonder why heâ€™s in such a mood? â€œ Usually Iâ€™d give him a cup of coffee and a bit of cake for being so entertaining but if heâ€™s going to just sit there looking like he wants to cry then he can sod off.â€ When asked why he was so down, McKay simply shook his head, muttered something about the government and then looked off down the street with a heavy sigh. Cook added: â€œSee. Whatâ€™s funny about that?â€
