Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Sunrise, Fla.
Contrary to his anti-establishment stance â€” which supporters readily boast as a viable alternative to Hillary Clinton â€” Donald Trumpâ€™s establishment roots run so deep, the billionaire real estate mogul plans to appoint a former Goldman Sachs partner and George Soros Fund manager as Secretary of the Treasury should he win the election.
Steve Mnuchin came on board Trumpâ€™s campaign as finance chair in May, raising eyebrows of many who felt his 17-year history with Sachs â€” and affiliation with liberal globalist George Soros as an Investment Professional of Soros Fund Management â€” conflicted directly with the then-presumptive nomineeâ€™s conservative stance and criticisms of establishment politicians.
â€œIt is difficult to see how a second-generation Goldman Sachs partner would secure such a prominent position in an administration delivered by a populist wind,â€ Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky told Politico of Trumpâ€™s curious choice for Treasury Secretary.
According to Fox Business Network , Trumpâ€™s confidence in winning the White House has fomented enough to begin picking Cabinet members, and besides the anomalous choice of Mnuchin for the Treasury, sources said heâ€™s considering New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for Attorney General and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for Homeland Security Secretary.
Trump has, of course, expended great efforts in criticizing opponent Hillary Clintonâ€™s deep ties to the banking and Wall Street elite; and prior to garnering the Republican nomination, extended that critique to competitor Ted Cruz, saying in one debate:
â€œI know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.â€
Zero Hedge noted when Trump hired the left-leaning hedge fund manager and financier as finance chair that Mnuchin had previously donated multiple times to various Democrats, including Barack Obama and none other than Hillary Clinton.
Further substantiating his establishing banking insider status â€” the precise profile Trump claims publicly to loathe â€” Mnuchin worked at Goldman Sachs for 17 years, headed OneWest Bank prior to its purchase by CIT Group in 2015, and now sits on CITâ€™s board while also serving as chairman and chief executive of Dune Capital Management, a private investment firm with a focus on financing big-time Hollywood movies, like â€œAvatar.â€
If Mnuchinâ€™s Wall Street ties donâ€™t trouble Trumpâ€™s supporters enough, the hedge fund managerâ€™s links to George Soros â€” an ardent Clinton fan â€” certainly will.
In fact, in terms of opposition, Soros has spent billions influencing global politics by inserting his brand of leftism wherever possible â€” and earlier this year even pledged , with others, some $15 million specifically to mobilize Latinos and immigrants to defeat Donald Trump.
â€œSteven is a professional at the highest level with an extensive and very successful financial background,â€ Trump said upon bringing Mnuchin into his campaign. â€œHe brings unprecedented experience and expertise to a fundraising operation that will benefit the Republican Party and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton.â€
Indeed, Trumpâ€™s campaign, Quote: d by the Daily Caller , said Mnuchin â€œhas previously worked with Mr. Trump in a business capacity and brings his expertise in finance to what will be an extremely successful fundraising operation for the Republican Party.â€
While business dealings certainly bring ordinarily clashing personalities into contact on occasion, these details about the relationship between Trump and Mnuchin evidence the formerâ€™s links to the left.
Despite the nomineeâ€™s many diatribes excoriating Hillary Clinton as out-of-touch with the American populace, Trumpâ€™s own status as a billionaire belies both their decades-old friendship and striking similarities â€” particularly as darlings of the establishment.
Should you choose to vote on the 8th, it would be prudent to keep in mind blustery campaign rhetoric â€” from any politician â€” only constitutes so much hot air.
