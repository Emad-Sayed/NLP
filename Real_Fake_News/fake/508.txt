Daily Mail October 27, 2016 Republicans say theyâ€™ll keep the heat on Hillary Clinton if she wins the Oval Office with new investigations into her family charity and quid pro quo allegations. Judicial Watch, a conservative group thatâ€™s been at the forefront of Clintonâ€™s email scandal, is already talking impeachment for the not-yet president. â€I know this generation of Republican leaders is loath to exercise these tools, but impeachment is something thatâ€™s relevant,â€™ the organizationâ€™s president, Tom Fitton, told NBC News. Fitton noted, however, that congressional Republicans were unlikely to follow his advice. â€They see [the oversight process] as an opportunity in some measure to keep their opponents off-kilter, but they donâ€™t want to do the substantive and principled work to truly hold corrupt politicians, or the administration, or anyone accountable,â€™ he charged. Republicans on Capitol Hill are gearing up for a bevy of new investigations involving Clinton in the next Congress.   8:32
