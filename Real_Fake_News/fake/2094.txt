when i awoke this morning the Dow Jones Propaganda Index was down 72 pointsâ€¦then in a matter of only a few minutes it inexplicably reverse ramped almost 100 points to turn positiveâ€¦ 
it was then that i decided to scour the Lamestream media, Alt-Media, and lastly ZeroHedge headlines to uncover what could be behind such a preposterous, absolutely fraudulent spike across all the Fraud indicesâ€¦ 
however before i could conclude my inquiry the DJPI spiked another 50 plus points to recapture the all important, CON fidence inspiring 18,200 mark coincidentally beginning exactly in the last 30 minutes of â€œtradingâ€ in the EuroPeon cesspool of fraud and manipulation - Londoneâ€¦ 
it was then that i realized that what had occurred was the same bullshit iâ€™ve witnessed for the last 5-7 years runningâ€¦that being that the Fraud Markets ramped on ABSOLUTLEY NO GENUINE POSITIVE MACRO-ECONOMIC, GEO-POLITICAL NEWS OR DATA WHATSOFUCKINGEVERâ€¦ 
at that moment , roughly 9:14 am, i realized that for todays "Fraud Markets Wrapâ€ to be posted latter in the day, i could simply â€œcut & pasteâ€œ from previous commentaries regarding what the rest of the day would portend because as i and many others have learned - â€œWhen the same bullshit happens every day thereâ€™s no need to typeâ€¦just cut and pasteâ€¦â€ - Kaiser Sousa - 
so thats precisely what i didâ€¦ "then, of course yet again all of the U.S. Fraud Indices entered into the sideways shuffle, ridiculous narrow â€œtradingâ€ pattern you all now as â€œsuspended levitationâ€ for the bulk of the dayâ€¦â€ - Kaiser Sousa - from every day the last 2 years. http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia 
then in the famous last 2 hours of â€œtradingâ€, and despite the â€œmarketsâ€ coughing up the phony reversal implemented by â€œyou know whoâ€,they nonetheless fought to the death to hold on to those â€œgreen shootsâ€ with â€œinvestorsâ€ piling into such noted bail weathers like , BOEING, NIKE, GE, and DISNEY pushing the DJPI back above the 18,200 markâ€¦ proving that the recovery in the land of the â€œexceptionalâ€™sâ€ continues to shower itsâ€™ waiters, bartenders, fast food servers, and interest income starved senior citizens with generational wealth and prosperity for allâ€¦ 
lastly, as for the blatant attempts to hold the phony paper prices of Gold & Silver within ridiculous â€œtrading rangesâ€ while the global financial and monetary system crumbles before â€œeyes that dare to seeâ€ alike every fiat currency (WITHOUT EXCEPTION!!) has throughout history - lets just say thisâ€¦how much more obvious can the Fed, Exchange Stabilization Fund, ThreadNeddle St. inbreeds, and Scum St. flunkies make it for you 
DEATH TO THE FUCKING MONEYCHANGERS.
