â€Ignoredâ€™ voter to become â€absolutely shaftedâ€™ voter 10-11-16 A TRUMP supporter has voted to make the government stop ignoring him and completely screw him over instead. Sawmill worker Tom Logan felt left behind by mainstream politics and finds Lady Gaga annoying, so voted for a billionaire whose main interests are money, â€pussyâ€™ and himself. Logan said: â€œTrumpâ€™s going to create well-paid blue collar jobs that are full of dignity and pleasingly masculine. I canâ€™t wait to be a hunky steel worker taking home $150,000 a year. â€œI know Donald wonâ€™t let me down, because why would someone lie about something thatâ€™s going to help them become the most powerful person in the world?â€ However economist Donna Sheridan said: â€œDespite Tomâ€™s optimism, Trumpâ€™s main business experience is getting idiots to do pointless tasks on a bullshit reality TV show. â€œTherefore his economic plan is likely to be talking about jobs, realising itâ€™s complicated, losing interest and then cutting welfare for all the people who still havenâ€™t got jobs. â€œMeanwhile his extreme stupidity will tank the economy, so in a few years Tomâ€™s main job will be catching squirrels and cooking them on sticks in a ditch. â€œOther job opportunities in the new America will include tooth puller, rat meat chef and crossbow-wielding encampment defender.â€
