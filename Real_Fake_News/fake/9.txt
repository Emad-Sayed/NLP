Hillary Clinton has barely just lost the presidential election and here she is already getting herself caught in another one of her tangled web of lies. 
The day after losing, a picture was posted of her taking her dog out for a walk. The picture was reportedly from a random hiker she ran into and showed that she was getting back to public life, or thatâ€™s what she wants you to believe. 
Now, I want you to do me a favor and take a very close look at this picture, specifically the â€œhikerâ€ she met. Memorize her faceâ€¦ 
Got it? Okay, good. 
Now what I am about to show you is something Hillary Clinton was hoping nobody else would notice. Tell me if the girl in the 2nd picture, taken in the 2000â€™s, reminds you of anyone: 
Yeah, it is the EXACT SAME GIRL! 
Her name is Margot Gerster and her mother just happens to be one of the big fundraisers for Hillary. Thatâ€™s actually where the older picture was taken. 
Wow! That doesnâ€™t seem random at all, does it? 
It looks like this is yet another example of Hillary Clinton trying to mislead the public using her inner circle and pretending like she doesnâ€™t know them. 
All I gotta say is, give it the Hell up, Hillary! You lost, nobody needs to see your â€œchance encountersâ€ or other promotional propaganda anymore. This is exactly why Americans ended up hating you! 
Oh well, I guess you really cannot teach an old dog new tricks. Well, in that case all thatâ€™s left to do is share this all across Facebook and the internet and expose yet another one of her Serial Lies!
