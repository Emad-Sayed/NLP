Print Side-by-side of Bill Clinton and Danney Williams 
NEW YORK â€“YouTube on Wednesday suspended the account of Danney Williams, the 30-year-old who has claimed since the 1990s to be the black son of former President Bill Clinton. 
YouTube, citing â€œrepeated or severe violations of our Terms of Use and/or Community Guidelines,â€ declared the account â€œcannot be restored.â€ 
The YouTube decision blocked the nine-minute feature â€œBANISHED â€“ The Untold Story of Danney Williams,â€ which had received 1.2 million views since Williams posted it last week. Produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, it drew nearly 100,000 views per day and more than 1,000 viewer comments, with the overwhelming majority expressing support for Williams and outrage at the Clintons for not being willing to allow a DNA test to determine paternity.

â€œMy YouTube account has been deleted, but the same video appears in 50 other places on YouTube alone,â€ Williams said on his Facebook page after being notified of YouTubeâ€™s decision. â€œ[YouTube] canâ€™t handle the truth! Please share #BillClintonSon.â€ 
Twitter also continues to allow Williams to post the â€œBanishedâ€ video on Danney Williamsâ€™ page , but the Twitter link to YouTube displays the message : â€œThis video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated. Sorry about that.â€ 
The video is still running on Danney Williams-Clintonâ€™s Facebook page , as well as on the YouTube channel operated by Gilbert. 
Attempt to silence Danney Williams? 
Gilbert told WND he helped Williams file an online appeal form on YouTube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated. 
â€œThe behavior of YouTube/Google in suspending Danneyâ€™s account is outrageous! There have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any YouTube terms or guidelines,â€ Gilbert said. 
Gilbert was outspoken in charging YouTube with partisan political motives for the suspension. 
â€œThe only possible explanation is that the Clinton campaign requested YouTube/Google to silence Danney, â€to run him off the plantationâ€™ as Danney said Hillary Clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the Arkansas governorâ€™s mansion in 1990,â€ Gilbert said. 
â€œDanney cannot be silenced any longer,â€ he continued. â€œHillary may try to sweep Danney Williams under the rug, but itâ€™s not going to work this time. His story is out there, and every day more and more people understand Bill and Hillary Clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin.â€

WND reported Oct. 19 that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate, attorneys for Williams were in Las Vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. 
Accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating Williams that went viral on the Internet. 
No definitive DNA test 
WND reported that no DNA test was conducted in 1999, despite media reports to the contrary when Williamsâ€™ claim first surfaced. 
Clinton defenders since 1999 have contended the tabloid Star Magazine conducted a â€œDNA showdownâ€ proving Bill Clinton was not Williamsâ€™ father, citing Star Magazine editor Phil Bunton saying at the time, â€œThere was no match, nothing even close.â€ 
But in an interview, Bunton told WND that no blood sample was obtained from Clinton and Star Magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test. 
â€œI donâ€™t remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on Clintonâ€™s DNA,â€ Bunton told WND. 
Bunton is now the owner of the Rivertown Magazine in Haverstraw, New York. 
He affirmed to WND that the tabloid relied on the DNA evidence for Clinton published by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, extracted from the infamous Monica Lewinsky blue dress. 
â€œWe got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media, including the New York Times, wanting to know when we were going to get the DNA back,â€ Bunton recalled to WND. â€œWe thought it was going to turn out to be his son, but when the DNA came back there was no story there even to write.â€ 
The DNA test released by Kenneth Starr was the second of two DNA laboratory tests the FBI had run on Clinton, but the public record leaves no doubt that Starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the FBI. 
â€Twitter rulesâ€™ 
Many other figures who have challenged the Democratic Party or the left-leaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets, including James Oâ€™Keefe and his Project Veritas, which has exposed Clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hidden-camera videos. Just as Oâ€™Keefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud Oct. 13, Twitter shut down his account , claiming violations of â€œTwitter Rules.â€ The notice said he â€œmust delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules, which prohibit: harassing other users, threatening other users, disclosing other usersâ€™ private informationâ€ or violating â€œother rules.â€ In a statement, Oâ€™Keefe said he relies on social media to â€œbypass the media and directly reach the public.â€ On Monday, Oâ€™Keefe wrote in a tweet Project Veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to YouTube, calling the apparent block â€œbizarre.â€ Earlier this month, Oâ€™Keefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a Hillary Clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day. His account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hidden-camera video that exposed a Clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns, the Daily Caller reported . Project Veritas posted an undercover video Oct. 17 proving Hillary Clinton supporters were inciting violence at Donald Trump rallies to gain negative media coverage. Millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours, but it didnâ€™t show up on Googleâ€™s â€œtrendingâ€ list on YouTube, which Google owns, noted SilenceisConsent.net . It did, however, trend on Twitter, which Google does not own. Breitbart blogger Milo Yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by Twitter minutes before his â€œGays for Trumpâ€ party at the Republican National Convention. For some 11 months, the makers of the new movie â€œIâ€™m Not Ashamed,â€ about the first victim of the Columbine killers in Colorado in 1999, were unable to promote their movie through YouTube. The trailer was taken down late in 2015, and the movieâ€™s entire channel was suspended . 
Among the conservatives censored by Facebook : Conservative activist and Trump supporter Lauren Southern received a 30-day ban from Facebook because she complained about a friendâ€™s account being censored. Facebook locked a 12-year-old black middle schoolerâ€™s account for posting a video supporting Rudy Giulianiâ€™s comment that Obama â€œdoesnâ€™t love America.â€ The admin of a pro-Trump group was banned for saying Trump is not anti-Muslim, but anti-ISIS.
