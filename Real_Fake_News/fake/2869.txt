A man with no DIY experience has set aside around 15 minutes to assemble a 300 piece cabin bed this weekend. 
Having glanced through the 36-page instruction booklet, 40-year-old Nick Ferguson plans to start the job at around 6pm on Saturday and will definitely be done by quarter past if not slightly before. 
â€Iâ€™ll simultaneously be making a vegetarian chilli,â€™ he said. â€And Iâ€™m going to complete both tasks in a cool and fun way that involves my three young children.â€™ 
Meanwhile Mrs Ferguson was hastily making plans to take the kids to her mothers. 
â€DIY with Nick is what you might call a journey,â€™ she said. 
â€One that begins relatively calmly, progresses to high strength alcohol and ends with him screaming Rudyard Kiplings â€Ifâ€™ into the mirror at around 1.30am. 
â€Usually with a serious injury to his face or hands.â€™ Matt Ward
