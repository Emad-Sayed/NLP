Donâ€™t listen to the LYING North Korea style media, who say minorities do not support Trump. 
The truth is, Donald Trump has AMAZING minority support. 
And his Hispanic support in Florida is outstanding! 
At one Miami precinct, voters began a parade-like storm, shouting â€œUSAâ€ and â€œMake America Great Againâ€ as they arrived at the polls to vote for America First!
