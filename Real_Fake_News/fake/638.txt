Elections 2016 
Top democrats have repeatedly waved off substantial questions arising from their hacked emails by falsely implying that some of them are forgeries created by Russian hackers. 
The problem with that is that no one has found a single case of anything forged among the information released from hacks of either Clinton campaign or Democratic Party officials. 

Clinton strategist Joel Benenson, asked about an email in which Clinton campaign staffers decide to accept foreign lobbyist money, used that line on MSNBC on Sunday. 
â€œThese emails, we have no idea whether theyâ€™re authentic or not,â€ he said. â€œOr whether theyâ€™ve been tampered with. I know Iâ€™ve seen things that arenâ€™t authentic, that we know arenâ€™t authentic, and itâ€™s not surprising.â€ 
Jennifer Granholm, a senior adviser to the pro-Clinton Super PAC Correct the Record, was asked by CNNâ€™s Jake Tapper whether the Clinton campaign should be responding to revelations revealed by Wikileaks. 
â€œThere are reports that these have been doctored,â€ she told Tapper on October 19. â€œAnd Newsweek had found that, in fact, that was happening.â€ 
In an interview with CNNâ€™s Wolf Blitzer on October 18, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, was asked if the Russian government would impact the election by hacking voting systems. 
â€œWhat worries me the most â€¦ is between now and the election the Russians dump information that is fabricated,â€ Schiff warned. â€œTo get a last minute dump of emails that contain fabricated emails that are widely reported in the press, and there isnâ€™t enough time to fact check and demonstrate the forgery, that is what really concerns me.â€ 
CNN host Wolf Blitzer pushed back, â€œBut have you confirmed that any of these emails released over the past two weeks, if you will, by Wikileaks are fabricated or doctored?â€ 
â€œYou know Iâ€™m not in a position to be able to do that,â€ Schiff demurred. 
Everything considered, the conclusion has to be that Wikileaks emails are probably authentic and if they werenâ€™t they would have been disproven a long, long time ago. The question is if are you willing to vote for a person that (we saw in the emails) is capable of doing very, bad, dirty stuff. And if the answer is yes then this country has a BIG, BIG PROBLEM. If Clinton Campaign Believes WikiLeaks Emails Are Forged, Why Donâ€™t They Prove It!? Share this:
