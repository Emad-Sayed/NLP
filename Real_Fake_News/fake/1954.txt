Tuesday 1 November 2016 by Pete Redfern Microsoft Outlook to introduce â€Hillaryâ€™ button to delete emails â€en masseâ€™ 
Microsoft has today announced that the next version of their popular email software will include a function that quickly and irretrievably deletes every email on the computer. 
Head of product development Simon Williams announced, â€œWith the FBI investigating Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails, we have recognised the need for a quick one-click button that will instantly remove all emails from your PC. 
â€œThis will be useful if you suddenly find yourself under investigation by the FBI. Or if youâ€™ve had a bit of a flirty email exchange with that girl from accounts who you felt you had a bit of chemistry with, but then you took it a bit too far that one time and now suddenly realise you are in grave danger of being dismissed for sexual harassment. 
â€œYou know, everyday sort of situations.â€ 
The new Microsoft Office suite is due to be released next year, and Outlook is reportedly not the only software with a Clinton inspired update. 
â€œWeâ€™ve tweaked Internet Explorer a little too,â€ continued Mr Williams. 
â€œFor those users who routinely forget to use InPrivate Browsing, we will be adding a â€Billâ€™ button which with one click will simultaneously close your browsing window and delete all of your search history and cookies. 
â€œThis will protect you from your wife ever knowing that you googled â€What is Monica Lewinsky up to these daysâ€™. 
â€œOr in the case of a regular user it will prevent your spouse finding out whatever niche, depraved pornography you are into when she unexpectedly returns from a work social an hour early and catches you mid self-pleasure. 
â€œAgain, just normal, everyday situations our customers find themselves in.â€ 
The button will be adjacent to the Minimize, Maximize and Close icons on the top toolbar, thereby saving the user a frantic search of the menus while pathetically attempting to conceal their erection as their significant other approaches.
