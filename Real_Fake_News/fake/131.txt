  
In case you missed it, on Sunday, FBI Director Comey once again cleared Hillary Clinton of any wrong-doing with regard to her emails â€” this, after just a couple of weeks ago saying to congress, that emails found in connection to the Anthony Weiner investigation could have something to do with Hillaryâ€™s case. By speculating about these mysterious emails, that we now know had absolutely NOTHING to do with Hillary Clinton, Comey may have been in direct violation of the Hatch Act . Letâ€™s hope Director Comey will have to endure his own investigation very soon! 
Speaking of speculation, on a special edition of CNNâ€™s AC360 Sunday night, Anderson Cooper brought up that very thing to Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. 
â€œIs it responsible for someone who might be president of the United States to be, in your words, â€speculatingâ€™ about an active investigation when he has no actual facts?â€ 
Kellyanne tried to change the attention back to Hillary Clintonâ€™s use of a private server, but Anderson wasnâ€™t having it and asks again. 
â€œRight, you are not answering the question, though. Is it irresponsible for a man who might be president of the United States to speculate about something about which he has no facts?â€ 
Watch their heated exchange below:
