STUDIES have shown that websites which fill their pages with headlines that end with three dots and a question mark have to do very little else to attract thousands of clicks from unsuspecting web users. 
The findings come after a year-long internet study, which found that content hosting sites can survive simply by exploiting the human brainâ€™s natural tendency to seek the answer to a question that is seemingly directed straight at them, even if they have very little interest in the subject at hand. 
Web users are just as likely to click through on headlines such as â€Did Amy Huberman show too much flesh at last nightâ€™s eventâ€¦?â€™ as they are on headlines such as â€Can this tractor pull this other tractor up a hillâ€¦?â€™, meaning that little or no effort is required to run a thriving media empire. 
â€œCan this kitten reach his foodâ€¦? Does this grandmother know all the words to Lose Yourselfâ€¦? Who cares, itâ€™s all clicksâ€ said one entertainment website owner. 
â€œOnce we worked out the old three dots and a question mark formula, then we knew we were set for life. People just canâ€™t help but click on that. Itâ€™s like catnip for the bored mindâ€. 
It is believed that the success of the formula is so great, that all news will come in that format in the near future. Already, Brian Dobson is working on his delivery of news headlines such as â€Were there many people killed in the Middle East todayâ€¦?â€™ and â€Did the government get the 8th amendment sorted outâ€¦?â€™.
