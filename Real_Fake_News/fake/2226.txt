A former FBI official described the Clintons as a â€crime familyâ€™ days after the bureau reopened its investigation into Hillaryâ€™s personal email server. 
James Kallstrom, the former assistant director of the FBI, spoke out against the Clinton family on Sunday in a radio interview with host and Greek-American billionaire businessman John Catsimatidis on â€The Cats Roundtableâ€™. 
â€The Clintons, thatâ€™s a crime family. Itâ€™s like organized crime, basically. The Clinton Foundation is a cesspool,â€™ Kallstrom said. 
â€Itâ€™s just outrageous how Hillary Clinton sold her office for money 
â€And sheâ€™s a pathological liar, and sheâ€™s always been a liar. And God forbid if we put someone like that in the White House.â€™ 
Kallstrom, who is best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late 1990s, also went after the FBI in the interview and said the initial investigation into the email server was â€never a real investigation.â€™ 
â€They never had grand jury empaneled. And the reason â€¦ was that Loretta Lynch would not go along with that,â€™ Kallstrom said. 
â€So this investigation was without the ability to serve subpoenas, serve search warrants, and obtain the evidence that they ended up begging for. It was just ludicrous what went on.â€™ 
He added that the FBI â€left so much stuff on the tableâ€™. 
Kallstrom did defend the agents who were tasked with investigating Clinton. 
â€This is not the FBI agents whoâ€™s to blame for this fiasco going on. This is the leadership. This is Jim Comey â€¦ The agents are furious with whatâ€™s going on. I know that for a fact,â€™ he said. 
Kallstrom praised Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a â€good human beingâ€™ and a â€patriotâ€™.
