Mark Ruffalo Reportedly Placed on U.S. Terrorist Watch List 11/02/2016

Actor Mark Ruffalo has reportedly been added to the governmentâ€™s terrorist watch list. 
The â€œThe Kids Are All Rightâ€ and â€œZodiacâ€ star was placed on the terror advisory list by Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Office of Homeland Security earlier this year after helping to promote the documentary â€œGaslandâ€ and speaking out about his concerns of natural gas drilling, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. 
Written and directed by Josh Fox, the film, which premiered on HBO this summer, put a light on the communities that are impacted by the natural gas drilling boom in the U.S. 
While Ruffalo, who will next appear as The Hulk in â€œThe Avengers,â€ may now face tedious secondary screenings at airports, the 43-year-old isnâ€™t too put off by the whole situation.
