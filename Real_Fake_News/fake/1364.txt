Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => 
Dear Mexican:  Por que no hay un pinche l­der entre nosotros o de nosotros los mexicanos? Para que tuviera los tanates bien puestos y hablara frente al congreso y les dijera sus verdades a los hip³critas pol­ticos. Ser que â€œnuestros lideresâ€ son unos miedosos o vendidos? No hay uno solo (solo el Chapul­n Colorado) que nos defienda, tanta humillaci³n que han tenido los negros, siempre de sirvientes o mozos, pandilleros y drogadictos (en Hollywood) y nadie protesta y salen con que Mem­n Penguin es ofensivo, otra de esas y nos subimos el cierre, eh? En serio , â€œAsk a Mexicanâ€ , Como podr­a yo hablar delante del congreso, local, estatal o federal? Ser­a mucho pedir? 
P³nganse las Pilas, Putos 
Dear Readers: For those of you who still donâ€™t habla â€”and if you donâ€™t habla ,  que chingado estas esperando ?â€” the writer asked whereâ€™s the Mexican leader whoâ€™ll take us into the Promised Land of American acceptance, then couldnâ€™t help but to attack blacks while he had my attention. Ya cllate con los â€œpinche negros,â€ pendejo . And Mexicans did have a messiah who saved us allâ€”his name was Juan Gabriel, and he recently died. 
Are there any states in which Mexicans are not yet a majority? 
Gabacho Really Wants to Know 
Dear Gabacho: Bruh, the Reconquista ainâ€™t that advancedâ€”yet. New Mexico has the highest percentage of Latinos at 47 percent of its total population, but most of them donâ€™t even consider themselves Mexican. The next-highest states are California and Texas, with 38.2 percent of their respective populations Latino per the U.S. Census, although Texas has the higher percentage of Mexicans in that group because of all the South Americans and Central Americans in California. And the state with the lowest Latino percentage of its people? West Virgina, at 1.3 percent. Raza : donâ€™t be scared, and move to the Mountain State. Donâ€™t forget that hillbillies are just brothers from a different madre . 

Forgive me for not using neat-sounding Spanish words in this email; my Spanish is rusty, and itâ€™s late. While I plan to learn it again, Iâ€™m getting ahead of myself. Reading through the archives of your column, it seems that you have forgotten, or chosen to ignore, those gabachos who actually do not hate the Mexicans. Take me for example. While this email is relatively devoid of Spanish phrases, I love the Spanish language. I studied it in high school, and wholly intend to learn it again, probably next semester. I love Mexican food, and I mean the real stuff (although I do enjoy Taco Bell as well). My high school was relatively small, and we had a lady come in to tutor the few of us who cared to learn Spanish. While she had lived here quite awhile, she had not assimilated into America . She cooked for us one day, and that started my love for authentic Mexican food. She also instilled in me a fascination for Mexican culture. I even would go so far as to say that I would support an amnesty program: Mexicans will always be here, so why not make them legal? If theyâ€™re not gonna do it the legal way, then we might as well throw in the towel. I wrote all this to simply remind you that not all Americans hate Mexicans: quite the contrary. Some of us love them! 
Too Tired to Think Up an Interesting Pen Name, or Any Interesting Questions 
Dear Gabachos: While I appreciate you and other gabachos who stand by Mexicans, be careful with your words: Trump just might deport you to if he wins. Oh, and #fucktrump
