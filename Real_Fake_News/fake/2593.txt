Clinton and her supporters have tried to blame Russia for hacking her emails and making them a focus in this election. 
In reality, itâ€™s likely that American intelligence and defense workers are the source for at least some of the leaks. 
The Guardian reports today: 
Deep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. 
*** 
The currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is â€œthe antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,â€ and that â€œ the reason why theyâ€™re leaking is theyâ€™re pro-Trump.â€

The leaks have not exclusively cast aspersions on Clinton. Paul Manafort, Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager, is the subject of what is said to be a preliminary FBI inquiry into his business dealings in Russia. Manafort has denied any wrongdoing. 
Moreover, Clinton supporters have claimed that the emails found on Anthony Weinerâ€™s laptop are only duplicates of emails the FBI has previously seen. 
However, CBS News reports : 
The FBI has found emails related to Hillary Clintonâ€™s tenure as secretary of state on the laptop belonging to the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, Anthony Weiner, according to a U.S. official. 
These emails, CBS Newsâ€™ Andres Triay reports, are not duplicates of emails found on Secretary Clintonâ€™s private server.
