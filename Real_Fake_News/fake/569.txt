BREAKING : LGBT Group Endorses Trump, Says, â€œHillary is Detrimental for Gaysâ€ BREAKING : LGBT Group Endorses Trump, Says, â€œHillary is Detrimental for Gaysâ€ Breaking News By Amy Moreno November 1, 2016 
Hillary is NOT a champion for gays. 
She takes MILLIONS from countries who abuse, imprison, and execute gays. 
Clinton turns a BLIND EYE to these grotesque atrocities to gays (and women) so she can keep lining her pockets. 
She even laughed when Trump asked her to return the BLOOD MONEY to these hateful countries. 
On top of that, Clinton wants to FLOOD America with Muslin refugees from these â€œmoderate Muslimâ€ countries that abuse, imprison, and execute gays and women. 
These people do not want to assimilate to Western culture â€“ they come here and spread their 7th-century HATE. 
This is why so many gays support Trump. 
From Washington Examiner : 
The Miami chapter of LGBTQ Log Cabin Republicans (LCR) announced on Monday its decision to break with the national organization to support GOP nominee Donald Trump for president. 
â€œWe, as Log Cabin Republicans of Miami, weâ€™re Americans first, weâ€™re Republicans second, and we happen to be gay or allies of the LGBT community. American national security is our governmentâ€™s first and foremost responsibility, then the economy â€“ those two issues really are paramount to any American,â€ Miami chapter president Vincent Foster told the Washington Examiner on Monday evening. 
â€œOur membership has gotten behind the Republican national nominee and itâ€™s unfortunate that other Republicans are unable to do so. Regardless of differences, we understand that a Hillary Clinton presidency is only going to be detrimental to the LGBT community and the general American population.â€ 
LCR announced on Oct. 22 that it would not support Trump despite his being â€œperhaps the most pro-LGBT presidential nominee in the history of the Republican Partyâ€ because he has â€œconcurrently surrounded himself with senior advisers with a record of opposing LGBT equality.â€ 
Foster said the national organizationâ€™s decision was a â€œbig surpriseâ€ and prompted the South Florida chapter to re-evaluate the matter. On Oct. 26, the 20 members of Miami LCR unanimously voted to endorse Trump. 
The Miami chapter has had a long-standing relationship with Trump, Foster explained. The billionaire businessmanâ€™s campaign initially reached out to the group months ago to work together in the battleground state. Foster added the campaign attended the groupâ€™s Lincoln Day dinner and has been fully supportive of them. 
â€œTo have a Republican presidential nominee who cares so much, especially after Orlando â€“ that resonated so much,â€ Foster said. 
Although LCR typically does not allow local chapters to support other candidates, the organization is allowing for flexibility in this election. The Washington, D.C.-based national group is permitting regional chapters to endorse or not endorse Trump in this election. 
Log Cabin Republicans in Cleveland, Los Angeles, Orange County, Texas and Georgia have also endorsed Trump, according to Angelo.
