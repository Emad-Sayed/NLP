By Sarah Jones on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 12:08 pm Donald Trump's Republican running mate Mike Pence has finally found something he's offended by, but it's not Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting African Americans or Mexicans or women or a Gold Star family. Nope. Pence is offended by a news report he hasn't read about their voter suppression efforts. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
â€œThatâ€™s offensive to me, that kind of language. Itâ€™s not our operation,â€ Indiana Governor Mike Pence said Friday morning on MSNBCâ€™s Morning Joe . 
Yes, Donald Trumpâ€™s Republican running mate Mike Pence has finally found something heâ€™s offended by, but itâ€™s not Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting African Americans or Mexicans or women or a Gold Star family. 
Nope. 
Did Pence read the story? No. But heâ€™s offended. So offended. Because that kind of language is offensive. Not the actual suppression of the votes, but the language, because itâ€™s not â€œour operation.â€ 
Watch here via MSNBCâ€™s Morning Joe : 
Twice saying he hasnâ€™t read the article, Pence proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how offended he was by something he hadnâ€™t read, â€œThatâ€™s offensive to me, that kind of language. Itâ€™s not our operation,â€ Pence denied. 
â€œDonald Trump and I want every American who has the opportunity to vote to vote in this election. And thatâ€™s our message, is to tell the American people that this country really belongs to them. That we can have government as good as our people again, but itâ€™s going to take all of us.â€ 
â€œAnd you saw Donald Trump â€¦ say that people who havenâ€™t traditionally voted Republican, weâ€™ve got an agenda to bring our cities backâ€¦â€ 
Pence is twice offended, so super offended: 
â€œIâ€™ve never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way. Frankly, you know, it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because thatâ€™s just not the approach Donald Trump has taken to this campaign. Itâ€™s not the approach weâ€™re taking. Weâ€™re reaching out to every American.â€ 
Pence then claimed Independents and even Democrats are breaking for Trump. In fact Trump and Pence are even losing groups that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. Pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame Republicans into voting for them by saying, â€œItâ€™s time for Republicans to come homeâ€ because Trump won the primary. 
Mike Pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done, because â€œItâ€™s just not what I see out there.â€ 
Trump also loves to cite what he â€œseesâ€ and reads, and often times those things turn out to not even exist â€“ like videos he claims to have watched. 
This explains why Mike Pence and Donald Trump ended up together. It turns out, they are not that different after all, in spite of the Republican establishmentâ€™s efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise. Both Pence and Trump donâ€™t care a whit about facts. This is more than typical campaign spin, itâ€™s appalling in context. 
The context is that Mike Pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a womanâ€™s â€œp*ssyâ€ without her permission, but he is publicly saying heâ€™s offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts. 
Pence didnâ€™t even bother to read the article, which suggests that he doesnâ€™t care if their campaign is really suppressing voters. But why would he? 
Pence didnâ€™t care about any of the groups Donald Trump insulted â€“ not enough to take a public stand, so why start now. But he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign. 
Like Trump, Pence is also insulted by language calling out bad behavior instead of the bad behavior.
