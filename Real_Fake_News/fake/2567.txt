Chips â€do not need to be cooked three timesâ€™ 03-11-16 ONCE-COOKED chips are perfectly fine, it has been confirmed. Researchers at the Institute for Studies decided to forego the now-standard â€triple-cookingâ€™ of chips and found that potatoes only need to be fried once to produce the desired result. Professor Henry Brubaker said: â€œIf you slice potatoes and fry them a single time, you get chips. Perfectly delicious chips. â€œI have no idea why youâ€™d do it twice more, unless you are some sort of imbecile.â€ Professory Brubaker confirmed that even if you were deep-frying a horse you would only need to do it once. He added: â€œGet oil, make hot, put thing in oil, take thing out, eat thing. â€œIf Heston Blumenthal told you to punch yourself in the ear would you do that too?â€
