Print Hillary Clinton with top aide Huma Abedin. 
WikiLeaks has provided a treasure trove of inside information on what Hillary Clinton really thinks about important issues such as trade and immigration, but Clinton herself has chosen not to answer questions about the revelations. 
She has focused instead on criticizing the Russians as the source of the hacks, despite the fact there is no proof of Russian involvement. 
The emails also shed light on how the Clinton campaign interacts with Wall Street banks, with friendly media, and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of Democratic rival Bernie Sanders with the help of the DNC. 
WikiLeaks says it has about 50,000 emails from the private Gmail account of John Podesta, a senior Democratic Party official who has served as White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton and a senior adviser to President Obama. He was the author of Obamaâ€™s climate change policy. John Podesta 
In February Podesta moved seamlessly from the White House to become chairman of Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign. 
Here are some of the most explosive revelations from the WikiLeaks email dumps featuring Podestaâ€™s account and others. 
Preference for Muslim Americans In 2008, when Podesta served as co-chair of President-elect Barack Obamaâ€™s transition team, Michael Froman, a former Citibank executive, sent Podesta a â€œlist of African American, Latino and Asian American candidates, broken down by Cabinet/Deputy and Under/Assistant/Deputy Assistant level, plus a list of Native American, Arab/Muslim American and Disabled American candidates.â€ The Arab American list came with a special note to exclude Arab Christians â€“ they had to be both Arab and Muslim.As New Republic reports, Obamaâ€™s eventual cabinet appointments ended up almost entirely as Froman recommended.Froman ultimately became the recipient of the largest bailout from the federal government during the financial crisis. 
Shielding Obama In a March 4, 2015, email to Hillary Clintonâ€™s lawyer Cheryl Mills, Clintonâ€™s eventual campaign chairman Podesta asks if they should withhold email exchanges between Clinton and President Obama that were sent over Clintonâ€™s private server.The day before Podesta sent his email to Mills, the House Benghazi Committee privately told Clinton to preserve and hand over all her emails.The email from Podesta to Mills says: â€œThink we should hold emails to and from potus? Thatâ€™s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I(t) seems like they will.â€ An email exchange between Podesta, Paul Begala, and Clinton pollster GQRR shows the Clinton campaign was pushing the Muslim Obama narrative back in January 2008. Included was a survey of Obama â€œnegative factsâ€ such as this one: â€œObama (owe-BAHM-uh)â€™s father was a Muslim and Obama grew up among Muslims in the worldâ€™s most populous Islamic country.â€ The pollster writes â€œwe have reworked the Obama message into the survey, as requested.â€ 
Secret speeches to Wall Street Hillary Clinton was so enraged that Bill Clinton was forced to cancel a paid speech at Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley in 2015 that she â€œneeded a cool down period.â€ The email chain, on March 11, 2015, before she formally launched her campaign, includes top aides to both Hillary Clinton and former President Clinton, and reveals that Hillaryâ€™s future campaign aides were concerned about the political impact of Bill giving a speech to a Wall Street bank. â€œMorgan Stanley is coming down,â€ wrote Robby Mook in an email to top Clinton aides.Top aide Huma Abedin explained that Hillary would not be happy about it, writing: â€œHRC very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech. I will have to tell her that [Bill] chose to cancel it, not that we asked.â€ Hillary Clintonâ€™s paid speeches to Goldman Sachs and other financial firms, a point of contention during this yearâ€™s primary, were the subject of an email to Podesta. Excerpts from some of the speeches had been flagged by Clintonâ€™s research team, including the necessity of having â€œboth a public and a private positionâ€ on issues. It was just part of â€œmaking sausageâ€ in the political arena, she said, that certain positions on issues needed to be kept hidden from the public. Some â€œflagsâ€ in Hillary Clintonâ€™s paid speeches were noted in a Jan. 25 email from campaign research director Tony Carrk to top Clinton advisers, including Clintonâ€™s declaration that â€œMy dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.â€ Countless establishment media outlets parlaying themselves as â€œfact checkersâ€ tried to downplay this email by saying it was â€œmostly about trade,â€ not immigration, as if the words â€œopen bordersâ€ were never mentioned. But the email exchange also shows how Hillaryâ€™s about-face on the TPP trade deal was mere pandering to Bernie Sandersâ€™ voters and had no basis in reality in terms of how she really feels about trade deals. In a speech at Goldman-Black Rock on Feb. 4, 2014, Carrk pointed out, Clinton admitted sheâ€™s â€œKind Of Far Removedâ€ from middle-class struggles due to â€œThe Economic, You Know, Fortunes That My Husband And I Now Enjoy.â€ Clinton, in other speeches, boasted of her ties to Wall Street, an issue primary opponent Bernie Sanders continually raised. Clinton still has refused to release transcripts of her paid speeches while blasting Donald Trump for not releasing his tax returns. 
Working in tandem with â€friendlyâ€™ media WND reported Tuesday emails showing reporters, editors and contributors not just advocating for Hillary Clinton but apparently colluding with the campaign. Univision Chairman Haim Saban urged the Clinton campaign to hit Donald Trump harder over immigration. The Boston Globe tried to time a Clinton opinion piece to do the most good in New Hampshire. CNBCâ€™s John Harwood urged Clinton campaign chairman Podesta to watch out for then-GOP candidate Dr. Ben Carson. Democratic National Committee official and CNN contributor Donna Brazile apparently tipped off the Clinton campaign to a potentially difficult CNN town-hall question on capital punishment during the Democratic Party primary season. Brazile adamantly denies it . In a July 2015 email, New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich appeared to ask permission from Hillary Clintonâ€™s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, to use certain quotes of the presidential candidate in an article. Palmieri replied, suggesting he remove a reference Clinton made to Sarah Palin and delete Clintonâ€™s statement, â€œAnd gay rights has moved much faster than womenâ€™s rights or civil rights, which is an interesting phenomenon.â€ CNBC correspondent John Harwood, who was widely criticized for posing biased questions to Donald Trump as a primary debate moderator, effectively served as an adviser to the Clinton campaign, emailing Podesta with the subject line â€œWatch out.â€ The warning was regarding GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson, who â€œcould give you real trouble in a general (election).â€ Maggie Haberman, a former Politico reporter who now works for the New York Times, was described in a January 2015 memo as having â€œa very good relationshipâ€ with the Clinton campaign. â€œWe have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed,â€ the memo said. 
Demeaning Catholics Podesta discussed fomenting â€œrevolutionâ€ in the Catholic Church with a progressive activist while Hillaryâ€™s now-communications director Jennifer Palmieri mocked Catholics who speak out against the liberal social causes of the Democratic Party. â€œThere needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church,â€ Sandy Newman, president and founder of the nonprofit Voices for Progress, wrote Podesta in February 2012 . The email, among the third batch released by WikiLeaks, was titled â€œopening for a Catholic Spring? just musing.â€ Podesta tells Newman of progressive organizations he and his colleagues created to recruit members of the church who can lead a revolution when the time is right.â€œWe created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this,â€ the Clinton campaign chairman writes. â€œBut I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up.â€ Clinton, who has accused Trump of praising Putin, called the Russian leader in a 2014 speech â€œengagingâ€ and â€œa very interesting conversationalist.â€ Excerpts from Clintonâ€™s speeches were contained in a document emailed to Podesta to point out quotes that could harm the campaign. 
Collusion with DOJ Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon alerted staffers that the Justice Department was proposing to publish Clintonâ€™s work-related emails, contending it showed collusion between the Obama administration and Clintonâ€™s campaign. Fallon wrote that â€œDOJ folksâ€ told him a court hearing in the case had been planned. The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, Podesta met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. Lawyers also told the Clinton campaign in emails that Hillaryâ€™s private email scandal â€œ smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing Iâ€™ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc .â€ 
Entanglements with foreign governments King Muhammad IV of Morocco made a $12 million pledge to fund the Clinton Global Initiative conference, but only if the likely presidential candidate attended the event as a speaker. Hillaryâ€™s top aide, Huma Abedin, wrote in a January 2015 email that â€œif HRC was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter.â€ Then she warned: â€œShe created this mess and she knows it.â€ Hillary ended up not attending but her husband Bill did. An email from Hillary Clintonâ€™s account to Podesta on Aug. 17, 2014, said Saudi Arabia and Qatar were â€œproviding clandestine financial and logistic support to [ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.â€ Critics have pointed out that the Clinton Foundation has received considerable funding from the two Middle East nations. In a leaked 2013 paid speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago, Hillary said Jordan and Turkey â€œcanâ€™t possibly vet all those refugees so they donâ€™t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.â€ Two years later she called for a 550 percent increase in the number of Syrian refugees coming to the U.S. largely from United Nations refugee camps in Jordan. 
Insiderâ€™s insider had sway over DNC A WikiLeaks email dump on July 22 revealed that Debbie Wasserman Schultz used her position as head of the DNC to work in concert with the Clinton campaign to undermine the candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt. Schultz was forced to resign over the emails. Issues used to undermine Sandersâ€™ campaign included his faith, or lack thereof. The Clinton campaign tried to reschedule the Illinois presidential primary to lower the chances a moderate Republican would get a boost following the Super Tuesday primaries. â€œThe Clintons wonâ€™t forget what their friends have done for them,â€ wrote Robby Mook, who later became Clintonâ€™s campaign manager, in the November 2014 email to Podesta.
