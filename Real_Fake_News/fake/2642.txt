  
Republicans just canâ€™t quit fantasizing about doing bodily harm to Hillary Clinton. Over the weekend, Sen. Richard Burr noticed a picture of Clinton hanging in a gun shop and decided the owners should put a â€œbullseyeâ€ on it. 
Speaking to GOP volunteers on Saturday , Burr joked that he had recently visited a gun shop and â€œnothing made me feel betterâ€ than seeing a magazine about riflesâ€œwith a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it.â€ 
â€œI was a little bit shocked at that â€” it didnâ€™t have a bullseye on it,â€ Burr told the crowd in Mooresville, North Carolina. â€œBut on the bottom right (of the magazine), it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, thereâ€™s an army of support out there right now for our candidates.â€ 
Burrâ€™s comments echo those of his partyâ€™s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, who has called on the â€œSecond Amendment peopleâ€ to â€œdo somethingâ€ about his Democratic opponent. However, Burr is at least pretending that he feels bad about his remarks. 
The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman issued an apology on Monday. â€œThe comment I made was inappropriate, and I apologize for it,â€ Burr said. 
A Burr campaign official said the Senatorâ€™s remark about feeling â€œbetterâ€ had nothing at all to do with the idea of Clinton being shot. Really. He was just referring to the support other right-wing candidates have gotten from various gun rights groups. Honest. 
Burr also said that if he is re-elected and Hillary should happen to win the White House, he will do all he can to continue obstructing the appointment of a ninth Supreme Court justice. When asked about the possibility of Merrick Garland, President Obamaâ€™s nominee, being appointed, Burr said, â€œit isnâ€™t going to happen â€” period.â€ 
â€œAnd if Hillary Clinton becomes president, I am going to do everything I can do to make sure four years from now, we still got an opening on the Supreme Court.â€ 
Burr also made it clear that he considers being responsible for the â€œlongest judicial vacancy in historyâ€ a badge of honor.
