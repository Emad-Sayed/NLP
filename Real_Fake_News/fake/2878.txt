The US should get rid of the illusion that there is the possibility of â€œtamingâ€ terrorists, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated.  
â€œTerrorism is like a snake: you turn your back on it and it bites you. Donâ€™t play with it,â€ she said in an interview to China Radio International. 
Zakharova remarked that Western and regional countries have invested a lot of forces and means in terrorist groupings. 
â€œBut these are terrorists, and they shouldnâ€™t be flirted with,â€ Zakharova added. 
In the diplomatâ€™s opinion, the actions of the American side, which is not allowing Jebat Al-Nusra to be destroyed, â€œare a clear manifestation of the fact that they are protecting it.â€  

Zakharova also noted that this is not the first time that Russia is clashing with such an approach by the US.
