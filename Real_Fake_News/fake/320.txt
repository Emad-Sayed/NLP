Store Guardian Front Page: â€œA 16-Year-Old Migrant Criesâ€¦â€ This image of a "16-year-old" migrant crying â€“ which is currently plastered on the front page of The Guardian â€“ is nothing short of laughable Chris Menahan | Information Liberation - October 27, 2016 Comments 
Wonâ€™t you take pity on this poor, innocent little child? 
This image of a â€œ16-year-oldâ€ migrant crying â€“ which is currently plastered on the front page of The Guardian â€“ is nothing short of laughable. 
â€œA 16-year-old from Ethiopia cries while he awaits registration at a processing centre in the makeshift refugee camp near Calais,â€ the photoâ€™s caption reads. The image is placed under a headline reading: â€œCouncils resist pressure to take children from Calais.â€ 

This crying â€œchildâ€ is supposed to make Brits feel guilty and demand their government allow â€œchildrenâ€ like him into their nation. 
The image is not a fake, nor is it being used satirically. It comes from the Associated Pressâ€™ Emilio Morenatti , you can see four pictures of the man for sale on their website . 
The â€œchild migrantâ€ is clearly in his 40â€™s, yet their editors evidently believe their readers are so incredibly stupid theyâ€™ll actually believe theyâ€™re looking at a 16-year-old boy. 
A look at Emilioâ€™s twitter shows one person appears to have actually bought the lie: @morenatti2004 Imposible no hacernos mirar y luego, un nudo en la garganta. pic.twitter.com/A7zvz5440q

â€œImpossible not make us look, then, a lump in the throat,â€ the tweet reads. 
Incidentally, Ethiopia is not even a war zone, so Iâ€™m not sure how this 45-year-old man can even be considered a â€œrefugee.â€ NEWSLETTER SIGN UP
