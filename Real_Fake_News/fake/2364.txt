[10/31/16] Hillary Clinton says she is open to making first lady Michelle Obama a member of her Cabinet should she become president. 
â€œSheâ€™s made it pretty clear she wants to focus on important issues like girlsâ€™ education around the world â€“ she and I actually talked about it when we were together in Winston-Salem [N.C.] â€“ and I want to be the best partner I can be for whenever she wants to be involved in government again,â€ she said in an interview with Extra released Monday. 
â€œI think she wants to take a break from it, but if she ever wants to do anything like that, I would be the number-one person.â€ 
Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, added that she admires Obamaâ€™s work both in the White House and on the campaign trail. 
â€œWell, I donâ€™t know how anybody could have done what sheâ€™s done for the last eight years with more grace and more of a sense of purpose but inclusivity,â€ she said. 
â€œSheâ€™s been an exemplary first lady, and I know how hard that job is,â€ added Clinton, who is herself a former first lady. â€œSo I feel so close to her and Iâ€™m so appreciative of all the help sheâ€™s giving me, all the confidence and courage, because itâ€™s hard.â€ 
President Obama said last Friday his wife would â€œnever run for office,â€ despite her high-profile role in the 2016 race. Post navigation
