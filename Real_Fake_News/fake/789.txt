[11/3/16] Music producer and singer Pharrell Williams bashed Donald Trump at an industry conference on Tuesday and said his defeat in the upcoming presidential election would be â€œeasyâ€ if every woman in America voted to elect Hillary Clinton. 
â€œIf all the women in this nation decided to vote and support the first female candidate, thereâ€™d be nothing to worry about,â€ Williams said in an interview at Variety â€s Inclusion summit at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills. â€œItâ€™s that easy.â€ 
â€œHas she been dishonest about things? Sure. Have you?â€ Williams said of Clinton, before insisting that â€œshe donâ€™t lie no more than any other politician does.â€ 
The Happy singer endorsed Clinton in March 2014, telling GQ magazine: â€œWeâ€™re about to have a female president. Hillaryâ€™s gonna win.â€ 
Asked about increasing polarization during the presidential campaign, the Grammy-winner paused and then pleaded with women to â€œsave the nationâ€ by not electing another â€œdestructiveâ€ male president. 
â€œThat silence in this room right now is often what I feel when you see some of the things that are being said, not just about my culture, but about women,â€ Williams said . â€œIâ€™m praying that women come together and save this nation. You think about the destructive things that have come from mankind, itâ€™s mostly men.â€ Post navigation
