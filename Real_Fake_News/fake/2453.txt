Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN A s the moment of truth approaches, Americaâ€™s two leading broadsheets, the NYT and WaPo, continue relentlessly bashing Trump, shamelessly supporting a woman belonging in prison, not high office. A same day article discussed The Timesâ€™ latest anti-Trump broadside. WaPo featured two editorials hammering him, following so many others earlier, disgracefully accusing him of everything imaginable, while practically elevating Hillary to sainthood by comparison. â€œWill Republicans respect democracy,â€ WaPo editors asked? How can anyone knowledgeable about how America is run respect whatâ€™s nonexistent, not earlier or now? â€œThe big question after Tuesdayâ€™s electionâ€¦will be whether the nationâ€™s leaders act to preserve our republic â€“ or hasten a descent toward a banana republic,â€ said WaPo editors. They failed to explain US governance resembles the way a crime family operates â€“ a godfather (or godmother) atop the hierarchy, serving privileged interests exclusively. .. The â€œfirst priority (for the nationâ€™s leadership) must be preserving and restoring the countryâ€™s democratic institutionsâ€¦â€ WaPo editors claimed. How can it when none exist? America is a rogue state, run by its lunatic fringe, neocon extremists, waging endless wars of aggression, punishing ordinary people with neoliberal harshness, enforcing police state viciousness on resisters, a hairâ€™s breadth from instituting full-blown tyranny â€“ likely coming with Hillary in charge. .. WaPo editors are terrified about how multiple investigations of her wrongdoing might turn out â€“ heading toward possibly indicting and impeaching her, ludicrously claiming: .. â€œThere is no substantiated charge against Ms. Clinton that would warrant impeachment, or even talk of impeachment. Despite suggestions otherwise, there is also no imminent indictment against the Democratic nominee, or any available evidence suggesting that indictment is a realistic possibilityâ€¦ Instead, what the nation has seen over the closing days of this campaign is a party preparing to (mis)use extraordinary congressional powers for despicable political ends.â€ 
Fact: Volumes of evidence show Hillary guilty of war crimes, orchestrating coups, other international and constitutional law violations, racketeering, perjury, obstruction of justice, fraud, influence-selling pay-for-play, and jeopardizing national security by using her private server for classified State Department documents â€“ enough to lock anyone up for life. 
Separately, WaPo editors said â€œTrumpâ€™s election would be a major threat to the economyâ€ â€“ a way over-the-top unjustifiable claim, saying: .. His â€œelection would be a major new source of instability here and abroadâ€¦Suddenly, a man with a deep-seated hostility to, and incomprehension of, markets would be at the helm of the worldâ€™s preeminent market economy.â€ A billionaire business tycoon with no comprehension of markets? No one could become super-rich without a keen understanding of how they work â€“ so what irks WaPo editors? .. They support jobs-killing trade deals like NAFTA and TPP. Trumpâ€™s justifiable opposition riles them. Theyâ€™re angry because heâ€™s right accusing the (Wall-Street controlled) Fed of keeping interest rates near zero for political reasons, along with government agencies fudging economic data like GDP, monthly jobs numbers and inflation, among others â€“ to make economic conditions look rosier than reality. .. Trump â€œfailed to level with the public about the challenges before us, to provide a plausible sense of how he would improve things â€“ or to demonstrate much of anything except the risks of entrusting him with management of an $18 trillion economy,â€ WaPo editors claimed. Agree or disagree with him, he presented a clearer agenda than Hillary â€“ time and again proving sheâ€™s a serial liar, dishonest, untrustworthy, ruthless and dangerous.
