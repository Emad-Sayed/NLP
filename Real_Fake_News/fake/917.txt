Cardinal Vincent Nichols says: â€œBritons could learn a lot from the â€vibrantâ€™ faith of Muslim migrantsâ€ British people have much to learn from the â€œvibrancy of the Muslim faithâ€ of new immigrants including refugees, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales has said. UK Telegraph Cardinal Vincent Nichols said immigrants had been enduring a worsening â€œatmosphere of fearâ€ in the months since the EU referendum with the members of the public casually voicing hatred in a â€œself-indulgentâ€ way. (Self-indulgent? I wonder what this French priest would have to say about that?) H e accused politicians of â€œtrading in fearâ€ and said media stories constantly portraying immigration in a negative light were proving â€œcorrosive of our best natureâ€. In an interview with the BBC , he insisted that increasingly secular British society could learn much from the faith of new arrivals whether Muslims or followers of other religions. â€œOf course what we have to learn too is from the vibrancy of the Muslim faith that comes here. H e added: â€œI think the immigration crisis is real and it needs concerted effort to address it,â€ he said. â€œIt needs to be addressed realistically with resources and proper legislation, but itâ€™s almost impossible to do that in an atmosphere in which fear and hatred are the dominant features. â€œIt does nobody any good, this somewhat self-indulgent way in which people have begun to express themselves and their distaste and their hatred of people who they see as different. â€œAnd that is creating a culture of fear among people who have been welcomed here.â€
