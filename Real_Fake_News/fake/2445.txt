Writing at the Federalist , libertarian NeverTrumper Cathy Young [ ] makes a convincing case that the election of Donald Trump, the supposed anti-PC candidate, could actually lead to an intensification of PC culture. Youngâ€™s basic thesis is that, if someone as, umm, letâ€™s say immoderate, as Trump could get elected President (in part as an anti-PC champion, no less), it would validate the PC belief that â€œcrude xenophobiaâ€ and â€œtoxic masculinityâ€ really are pervasive problems. [ Why Electing Donald Trump Could Make Political Correctness Worse , November 7, 2016] And so the PC crowd would double-down even further. 
I think this is a good analysis. Of course, Youngâ€™s implicit assumption is that increasing political polarization is a problem that can be solved, that a center-Right, classical liberal consensus is the goal. But the time for that has passed. So kudos to Young for identifying the problem, but we need a new solutionâ€”such as Michael Hartâ€™s proposal for the peaceful secession of Red State America.
