â€œWhy I Wonâ€™t Vote for Hillary Clinton | Evan Edingerâ€ (but then he changes his mind on that) TO CLOSE : Evan Edlinger will vote for Hillary against Trump because he thinks that whereas Hillaryâ€™s actual track-record of policies (not mere statements) in public office have been horrific, Trumpâ€™s bad statements and lack of any track-record in public office at all, make Trump even worse. Thatâ€™s what he thinks. I think it makes Trump better â€” the better choice â€” as opposed to the proven evil and catastrophically harmful public official, Hillary Clinton. Edlinger is preferring an evil record as a public official, to no record as a public official. Edlinger fails to make two crucial distinctions: One is that he fails to distinguish between mere political statements, versus actual political policies carried out as a public official (which show Hillary to be a proven neocon and tool of Wall Street); and the other is his failing to distinguish between a bad record in a personâ€™s private or business affairs, versus a bad record as an actual public official. Only the bad record as a public official should be absolutely disqualifying â€” and thatâ€™s Clinton, not Trump, who has a horrific record as a public official. Trump has no record at all as a public official. Edlinger at 1:30 in his video says that when he contemplates voting for Hillary,â€Thereâ€™s always one thing that comes in the way, and thatâ€™s trust.â€ He says he doesnâ€™t trust her â€” but what he doesnâ€™t actually â€œtrustâ€ is her words; when he says heâ€™ll vote for her, heâ€™s simply ignoring her actions, heâ€™s ignoring the real person-as-a-public-official, the person who is shown and displayed beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever. Proven selfishness in oneâ€™s private life is bad, but proven selfishness and evil in oneâ€™s public-office policies (such as â€œWe came, we saw, he died. Ha, ha!â€ ) is utterly disqualifying. I argued in my â€œIâ€™m a Bernie Sanders Voter: Hereâ€™s Why Iâ€™ll Vote Trumpâ€ , that Trump could possibly turn out to be a progressive President; but, even if he turns out to be a bad President, he wonâ€™t, on balance, be as horrific as will a President Hillary Clinton. With Trump, there is reason to have some hope for the future of the world; with Clinton, there is reason to expect unprecedented horrors .

NOTE: The Greanville Post editors have a clear position on this so-called election: If you MUST vote, vote Green, for the Jill Stein, Ajamu Baraka ticket, as a PROTEST VOTE. If that is not possible in your area, do not bother to vote, as all votes serve to legitimate a fraudulent process and the ongoing reign of the corporate/military/media complex. =SUBSCRIBE TODAY!
