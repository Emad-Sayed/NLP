Conan Oâ€™Brien asked comedian Louis CK who heâ€™s choosing between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in this years election, his answer was amazing! He said: 
â€œIâ€™m going to vote for Hillary becauseâ€¦ I think sheâ€™s great! Itâ€™s not a lesser of two evils. I think sheâ€™s great, sheâ€™s really talented and I think sheâ€™s super smart, I would take her over anybody else that would do it. To me itâ€™s really exciting to have the first mother in the White House, itâ€™s not just about the first woman, itâ€™s about the first mom. Because a mother sheâ€™s got it! A mother just does IT. She feeds you, and teaches you, she protects you. She takes care of shit.â€ 
â€œWeâ€™ve had 240 years of fathers. Father after father. Bald Father. Fat Father. Every kind of Father. Fathers are ok. Iâ€™m a dad, youâ€™re a dad. A GREAT father can give his kids about 40% of their needs. Any mother, even a not even trying mother can give 200%!â€
