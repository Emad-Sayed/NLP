By Lasha Darkmoon on November 1, 2016 Tom Leonard â€” Darkmoon.me Oct 31, 2016 with pictures, captions, and comments by Lasha Darkmoon Hillary Clin­ton faced an up­set in her run for the White House two days ago af­ter the FBI an­nounced a fresh probe into her emails. In­ves­ti­ga­tors will examine new mes­sages to see whether she sent clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion on a private server. Just ten days be­fore Amer­i­cans go to the polls, the Demo­crat candidateâ€™s bid to be­come the first woman US pres­i­dent may be de­railed if it is de­cided she should face crim­i­nal charges. â€I AM INNOCENT!â€™ Recent Polls sug­gest Mrs Clinton will trounce Repub­li­can ri­val Don­ald Trump, who has been strug­gling to fight al­le­ga­tions about grop­ing women. But Mrs Clin­ton will now be forced on the de­fen­sive her­self in the fi­nal days of their vi­cious elec­tion bat­tle. LD : The latest news is that Hillaryâ€™s 12-point lead has been â€œ wiped out â€ within the last 24 hours, with Hillary now just one point ahead of Trump. This could of course change at any moment, with rapid fluctuations, depending on the volatility of the situation. FBI di­rec­tor James Comey had rec­om­mended ear­lier this year that the Department of Jus­tice not press charges over emails sent by Mrs Clin­ton when she was sec­re­tary of state un­der Barack Obama. But he said â€re­cent de­vel­op­mentsâ€™ had prompted him to take an­other look. The agency has ob­tained new emails from an un­re­lated case that â€ap­pear per­ti­nentâ€™ to the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, said Mr Comey. A ju­bi­lant Mr Trump hailed the dra­matic de­vel­op­ment of a re-opened investigation as â€big­ger than Water­gateâ€™, a ref­er­ence to the cor­rup­tion scan­dal that brought down Richard Nixon. â€Bigger than Watergateâ€™ The con­tro­versy has weighed heav­ily on the cam­paign, chal­leng­ing Mrs Clintonâ€™s key con­tention that â€“ un­like her opponent â€“ she would be a safe pair of hands in the White House. Mr Comey an­nounced in July that the FBIâ€™s 12-month investigation into Mrs Clintonâ€™s con­tro­ver­sial email traf­fic while secretary of state was over. She was crit­i­cised for us­ing a pri­vate email server rather than the of­fi­cial system to trans­mit clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion, but escaped prose­cu­tion. In a harshly-worded crit­i­cism of her â€ex­treme care­less­nessâ€™ and â€gross negligenceâ€™, Mr Comey said it was pos­si­ble that hos­tile for­eign govern­ments had gained ac­cess to her poorly-pro­tected ac­count. He also flatly con­tra­dicted var­i­ous Clinton claims al­though â€“ in ex­plain­ing why he had not rec­om­mended pros­e­cut­ing her â€“ he ac­cepted there was no evidence she had in­ten­tion­ally jeop­ar­dised state se­crets. The scan­dal has been bran­dished by Repub­li­cans as ev­i­dence of Mrs Clin­tonâ€™s dis­hon­esty and in­com­pe­tence. Mr Comey informed Congress by let­ter that his agency had ob­tained new emails. They will be re­viewed to see if they are sig­nif­i­cant and if new ac­tion against Mrs Clin­ton is re­quired. Mr Comey did not give a time­frame for how long this in­ves­ti­ga­tion will take. The orig­i­nal FBI probe found that of 30,000 emails Mrs Clin­ton handed over to the State Depart­ment, 110 con­tained in­for­ma­tion that was clas­si­fied at the time she sent or re­ceived them. How­ever, an­other 33,000 emails went miss­ing. They were pre­sumed to have been per­ma­nently deleted but newly re­leased FBI notes sug­gested they still ex­ist in sev­eral locations and could be re­cov­ered. It is un­clear whether any of these are in­volved in the new FBI in­quiry. Law en­force­ment of­fi­cials said the newly dis­cov­ered emails were taken from the elec­tronic de­vices of se­nior Clin­ton aide Huma Abe­din and her dis­graced hus­band An­thony Weiner dur­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion in the lat­terâ€™s â€sex­tingâ€™ of girls. Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin. Click to enlarge Note by LD : Huma Abedin is an American Muslim of Indo-Pakistani descent. Weiner is a disgraced Jewish politician who has been involved in a series of sex scandals. When Huma found out about her husbandâ€™s sleazy sexual activities, she was forced to divorce him. This was in August 2016. The unlikely couple had been married for just over six years. As for Huma, her relationship with Hillary Clinton has been an extraordinarily close one for almost 20 years, so much so that there have been sensational rumors of a lesbian liaison . The view for popular consumption is that Hillary is Humaâ€™s â€œmentorâ€ and â€œmother figureâ€. Hillary once compared Huma to her own daughter Chelsea. â€œI have one daughter,â€ she said. â€œBut if I had a second daughter, it would be Huma.â€ Humaâ€™s real mother, noting that Hillary had now replaced her in her daughterâ€™s affections, once told Hillary jokingly, â€œIâ€™m jealous of you!â€ (See here ) John Lennonâ€™s widow, Yoko Ono ( pictured ), claims to have had a lesbian affair with Hillary in the 1970s. â€œWe met many times,â€ Yoko boasts, â€œand became very intimate ! â€ (LD) TOM LEONARD continues : Weiner, a for­mer Demo­crat con­gress­man for New York, be­came em­broiled in a se­ries of scan­dals over ex­chang­ing sex­u­ally ex­plicit text mes­sages with a string of women. He sep­a­rated from Miss Abe­din, vice chair­man of the Clin­ton cam­paign, in Au­gust. It is un­der­stood the FBI is in­ves­ti­gat­ing Weiner af­ter it was re­vealed that he had been sex­ting a high school stu­dent who was 15 at the time. Mr Trump re­acted with de­light to Mrs Clin­tonâ€™s 11th-hour elec­tion night­mare. Ad­dress­ing a ju­bi­lant crowd in New Hamp­shire, Trump said: â€ Hil­lary Clin­tonâ€™s cor­rup­tion is on a scale weâ€™ve never seen be­fore. We must not let her take her crim­i­nal scheme into the Oval Of­fice.â€™ Mr Trump had pre­vi­ously crit­i­cised the FBI and Depart­ment of Jus­tice for not bring­ing charges against his elec­tion opponent. His run­ning mate, Mike Pence, called on the FBI to im­me­di­ately re­lease all the emails per­ti­nent to the investigation, adding: â€The Amer­i­can peo­ple have a right to know.â€™ The Repub­li­can vice pres­i­den­tial can­di­date told a rally in Penn­syl­va­nia, that he and Don­ald Trump â€com­mend the FBI for hav­ing the courage to re­open the caseâ€™. Chants of â€Lock her up!â€™ came even be­fore Mr Pence ref­er­enced the FBI investigation. Mrs Clin­ton ig­nored shouted ques­tions from re­porters about the new FBI investigation as she walked off her plane in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the most se­nior Repub­li­can in Congress, said she had be­trayed Amer­i­cansâ€™ trust for han­dling â€the na­tionâ€™s most im­por­tant secrets. HOT NEWS!
