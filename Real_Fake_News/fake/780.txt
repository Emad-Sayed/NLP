In a story that predictably did not make the mainstream media, and with video surveillance very difficult to find, a massive mob of black teens viciously attacked white Temple University students, police officers and even a police horse in Philadelphia on Friday night.

In the limited local coverage this story did receive, the race aspect was generally avoided. It is way past time to take back the media, and fill it with truth-tellers, not apologists. 
â€œMore than 150 teens, spread out in groups of 20 or 30, descended upon the campus at around 8:30 p.m. Friday â€” wreaking havoc for nearly two hours before eventually dispersing,â€ according to NBC 10 â€¦. 
But there is a reason for all of this horror, according to Solomon Jones of Philly.com . It evidently boils down to the progressive canard â€œwhite privilege.â€ 
The black teens are feeling excluded because evil white â€œothersâ€ have come into their neighborhood and built rental properties for college students, raising the property values of their neighborhoods in a way that evidently excludes the angry teens, who were used to having their blighted turf unmolested.
