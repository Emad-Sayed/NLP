UNREAL: Calif. Soldiers Billed for Thousands After Military Decides Not to Honor Decade-Old Enlistment Bonuses 
Why, West wondered, would any sane citizen risk his or her life to serve in a military system so corrupt and backward that it would make its veterans pay back their rightfully earned bonuses?

â€œThey did nothing wrong, they didnâ€™t seek to defraud our nation â€” heck, they put their lives on the line to backfill the manpower shortages made by politicians and government bureaucrats,â€ he continued. â€œIs this truly how we honor those who have served?â€
