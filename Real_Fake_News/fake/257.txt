TAOISEACH Enda Kenny has congratulated US president-elect Donald Trump, after he beat Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in a dramatic election count result this morning. 
Mr. Kenny said the people of the United States have made a very clear choice and that he always knew Trump would win the presidency, stating he looks forward to meeting him soon. 
â€œIâ€™ve always been an admirer of Donald Trump,â€ Mr. Kenny opened up, scratching his nose, â€œSuch a lovely man and a deserving president. I was rooting for him from the very beginning of this campaign, and I hope to meet him and his beautiful first lady very soonâ€. 
However, sources in Leinster House confirmed that an emergency Government meeting was called early this morning in a bid to decide who goes to the US for St. Patrickâ€™s Day 2017. 
â€œThe Taoiseach requested a box of straws and a scissors,â€ one insider said, â€œI think Leo Varadkar picked the short straw and may have to meet Mr. Trump with a bowl of Shamrock in the White House next yearâ€. 
Asked about his comments about Mr. Trump being â€racist and sexistâ€™ earlier this year, the Taoiseach claimed he was only messing at the time and that he was only poking fun at the future president of the United States. 
â€œDonald will know I was only blaggarding with him,â€ Kenny stated, â€œweâ€™re always messing and joking like that in politics. I look forward to playing a round of golf with him in Clare,â€ adding, â€œIâ€™m more concerned about making the Irish recovery great againâ€.
