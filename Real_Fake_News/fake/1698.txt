â€œBrexit means Clusterfuckâ€ confirms Prime Minister 
Theresa May has clarified that Brexit actually means one giant, steaming clusterfuck. 
The reincarnation of Emperor Palpatine made the statement following the High Court ruling that Parliament would have to give the go-ahead for Britain to officially tell the EU to piss right off. 
â€œBrexit does indeed mean clusterfuck,â€ said the Prime Minister, giving the pained smile of a woman who knows sheâ€™s going to be the historical equivalent of Basil Fawlty. 
â€œBut it is the clusterfuck that the people voted for, and by God, we shall see to it that this clusterfuck gets done right and proper. 
â€œI mean, Iâ€™d rather not, because itâ€™s going to be dreadful and tedious, but thatâ€™s democracy for you.â€ 
Brexiter, Simon Williams, said,â€If â€clusterfuckâ€™ means â€taking back controlâ€™ then I say bring on the clusterfuck and damn the consequences. 
â€œWeâ€™ve already told the experts where to go; there is no going back. Brexit means clusterfuck, and I demand to be clusterfucked immediately.â€ Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently
