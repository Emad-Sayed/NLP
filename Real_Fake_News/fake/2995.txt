â€Go Back to Where You Claim Home,â€™ Kansas Lawmaker Tells Protester Dion Lefler, Wichita Eagle, October 25, 2016 
Kansas state Rep. Joe Seiwert commented on Facebook that an African-American singer who knelt while performing â€œThe Star Spangled Bannerâ€ at a Miami Heat game should â€œgo backâ€ to where she claims as home. 
Seiwert, R-Pretty Prairie, posted that comment and a longer follow-up on an anti-black meme that was originally posted to a pro-Donald Trump Facebook group and then shared by one of Seiwertâ€™s constituents. 
Seiwert confirmed the comments were his and said he was exercising his First Amendment right to free speech, as he says the woman in the meme did when she wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt and knelt while singing the anthem.

The photo in the meme is of Denasia Lawrence, a Miami social worker and, according to the Miami Sun-Sentinel, a part-time game-night employee of the Heat professional basketball team. The team has issued a statement saying team officials were unaware that Lawrence planned to protest when they asked her to sing the anthem at Fridayâ€™s preseason game with the Philadelphia 76ers.

To which Seiwert responded: â€œI am where I claim home and like it, they want to claim it and it is their right to go where ever they like, so if they donâ€™t like it here, I believe that their freedom completely allows them to go wherever they believe is more free and non racist if thatâ€™s what they believe.â€ 
Seiwert said he didnâ€™t see the profanity in the meme when he commented and didnâ€™t do anything wrong. 
â€œI have a personal life besides a legislative life,â€ he said. â€œMaybe it was inappropriate; I donâ€™t believe so, because I said nothing derogatory. And I believe that (if) people are that upset with the national anthem, they can do whatever they want to on their own time, but when theyâ€™re using it on national TV to make a statement, thatâ€™s not right. 
â€œI said if she (Lawrence) doesnâ€™t like it here, then go where she would like it. Whatâ€™s wrong with that?â€ he said. 
Asked why a person should leave rather than try to change things where they are, Seiwert responded: â€œBecause maybe thereâ€™s other people who donâ€™t want their place changed.â€ 
He also said he did not think his comments had anything to do with race. 
â€œIt donâ€™t make any difference if theyâ€™re black, white or green, itâ€™s the disrespect to our country,â€ he said. â€œAnd why does everybody put the color to it?â€

The person who made the meme took a photo of Lawrence from the web and added, in capital letters, â€œKNEELING WHILE SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM . . . Iâ€™M SO SICK OF THESE ANTI-AMERICAN BLACKS . . . (Expletive) BLACK LIVES MATTER.â€ 
Seiwertâ€™s comment, directed at Lawrence, was: â€œGo back to where you claim home than (sic).â€
