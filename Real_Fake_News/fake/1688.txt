[10/31/16] The company plans to appeal the decision. 
Johnson & Johnson has lost its third lawsuit alleging that the pharmaceutical companyâ€™s baby powder causes ovarian cancer. 
Jurors in St. Louis awarded Deborah Giannecchini $70 million late Thursday, according to Bloomberg . For 40 years, Giannecchini, 62, had used the talcum powder for feminine hygiene, but stopped when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer three years ago. Now her lawyers say Giannecchini has an 80% chance of dying in the next two years, despite having undergone extensive treatment. 
Carol Goodrich, a spokesperson for Johnson & Johnson, says the company will appeal to the decision . 
â€œWe deeply sympathize with the women and families impacted by ovarian cancer,â€ she said. â€œWe will appeal todayâ€™s verdict because we are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnsonâ€™s Baby Powder.â€ 
Additionally, research into the link between talc and cancer have been been mixed or inconclusive, according to the American Cancer Society . 
That likely factored into a New Jersey judgeâ€™s decision to throw out two lawsuits against Johnson in Johnson in September, which alleged that the companyâ€™s talcum powder had caused their ovarian cancer. Post navigation
