October 28, 2016 Susan Rice: U.S. Must Integrate LGBT Rights into Govâ€™t and Foreign Policy 
National Security Advisor Susan Rice told students at American University in a speech on LGBT rights Wednesday that the â€œUnited States must continue to integrate LGBT rights into our government and foreign policy,â€ including â€œcreating a more diverse national security workforce.â€ 
â€œThis is an issue that Iâ€™m particularly passionate about, and one that President Obama has prioritized,â€ Rice said, â€œbecause without tapping Americaâ€™s full range of races, religions, ethnicities, social and economic experiencesâ€”without embracing people of every sexual orientation and gender identityâ€”weâ€™re leading in a complex world with one hand tied behind our back.â€ 
Rice, who once served as U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said that â€œwhether we are talking about race, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity, this fight for equal rights is what our history and values demand.â€
