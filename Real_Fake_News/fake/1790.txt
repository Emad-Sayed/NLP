Tony Blair helpfully describes Remain voters as â€insurgentsâ€™ 28-10-16 
TONY Blair has helped out British politics by calling Remain voters â€insurgentsâ€™ who must â€mobiliseâ€™. 
Both sides of the Brexit debate have thanked the former prime minister for framing it in loaded terms that will bring out the best in everyone. 
Healthcare worker Helen Archer said: â€œLetâ€™s see. So on one side weâ€™ve got the Brexit crew already calling anything they donâ€™t like treason and waving flags. 
â€œOn the left weâ€™ve got the disturbed followers of a cultish messiah who want the result of a popular vote to be overturned, followed by the overthrow of capitalism. 
â€œAnd a deposed ruler who started two unending wars for the sake of his ego is telling us itâ€™s a war? 
â€œGreat. No problem. Just checking I know where weâ€™re headed.â€ 
Blair said: â€œMy primary role, in and out of government, has been to boost sales for the UK arms industry and that will not change.â€
