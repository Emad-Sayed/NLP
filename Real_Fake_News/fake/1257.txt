All Brexit arguments settled by 0.5 per cent third-quarter growth 28-10-16 
ALL debates about the negative impact of Brexit have been settled for good by Britainâ€™s 0.5 per cent third-quarter growth. 
Leading Remain campaigners, including former chancellor George Osborne, are preparing public apologies and the nationâ€™s 16 million Remain voters are expected to follow suit. 
Joanna Kramer of Bristol said: â€œItâ€™s not easy to admit youâ€™re wrong but I donâ€™t see I have any choice. 
â€œBritain is thriving with only a 0.2 per cent decline on expected growth, national pride has exploded into a proud display of healthy scepticism towards supposed child refugees, and I was a fool. 
â€œHow could I have been so blind not to see that glory would be upon us this soon, if only we had the courage to take back control? 
â€œIâ€™m sorry, everyone. Iâ€™m sorry I was a traitor.â€ 
Brexit voter Stephen Malley said: â€œWhat am I going to do for conversation now?â€
