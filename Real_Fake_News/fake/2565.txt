Trumpâ€™s Camp Manager DESTROYS Hillary By Pointing Out 1 Thing We All Missed Posted on October 30, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Fox News Host (left), Trumpâ€™s Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway (right) 
From the moment the FBI announced theyâ€™re investigating Hillary Clinton again, her ship of supporters quickly became lighter with people bailing out to protect themselves from being associated with her as a criminal. Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign couldnâ€™t have asked for better vindication that the witch could soon be incarcerated, but the Republican candidateâ€™s campaign manager just put the final nail in Clintonâ€™s coffin. 
In the wake of this latest development that could save Western civilization, Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News to discuss it, but she delivered more than viewers were expecting. In a statement that didnâ€™t just decimate Hillaryâ€™s campaign, she brought the entire Clinton family down with it in one perfectly stated sentence. 
When the FBI cracks a case back open that they had previously closed, thereâ€™s a legitimate reason to be terrified for the outcome of that investigation, and itâ€™s almost guaranteed to end in incarceration. Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom validated this when he said after the announcement that the final bomb is about to drop on Hillary within the next ten days. Adding to everything coming back to haunt Hillary since Friday, is what Conway said on Fox News: 
â€œWhat we are reminded of is this cloud of corruption that always follows Hillary Clinton and we are having this entire conversation about a renewed FBU investigation because Hillary Clinton did what she always does, put Hillary firstâ€¦we can never get the stench and the stain of the Clintons off if us it turns out.â€ 
Call it karma or the combined forces of WikiLeaks, James Oâ€™Keefe, and now the FBI, who are all working together to bleach this â€œstainâ€ from the White House, but things just arenâ€™t looking good for Hillary who had it coming. Hopefully, the FBI who failed the American people after the first investigation that ended with her still being able to run for president, make good on that mistake by actually arresting her after round two. 
The investigation now is entirely different than the first, considering the fact that it was reopened. For that reason alone, Hillary shouldnâ€™t feel comfortable about the outcome.
