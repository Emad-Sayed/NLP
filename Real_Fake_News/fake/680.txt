A Book Too Dangerous To Read A Book Too Dangerous To Read? 
by Jennifer Margulis   Library Journal , which librarians read to decide what books to buy for their collections, announced last week that libraries should not carry the new book, The Vaccine-Friendly Plan : Dr. Paulâ€™s Safe and Effective Approach to Immunity and Health, From Pregnancy Through Your Childâ€™s Teen Years , which I co-authored with Paul Thomas, M.D., a Dartmouth-trained pediatrician who has over 13,000 patients in his pediatric practice in Portland, Oregon. 
â€œThe authorâ€™s style is gentle and motivating,â€ the reviewer writes, â€œand he clearly cares for parents and children. Despite this, many parents will have a hard time following some of his suggestions (e.g. no manufactured baby food, no formula, no circumcision, avoid acetaminophen), as he advises parents to come to â€œwell child visits with a signed vaccine refusal formâ€ and specifically warns against hepatitis, chicken pox, flu, polio, and HPV vaccines, among others.â€ 
The review goes on: 
â€œVERDICT While Thomas does recommend a number of vaccines, his medical wisdom is too removed from both the AAP and the CDC (Centers   Prevention) guidelines to warrant a recommendation.â€ 
Donâ€™t make this book available to library patrons. 
Donâ€™t read this book. 
Donâ€™t even have a conversation about safety issues with childhood vaccines. 
Instead, letâ€™s just ignore the fact that the current rates of autism are at least 1 in 68, according to the CDC (possibly as high as 1 in 45 , also according to CDC data), that thereâ€™s a growing body of very disturbing scientific evidence showing that acetaminophen (the main ingredient in Tylenol) is triggering autism , and that American children today are plagued with allergies, asthma, and other chronic diseases (like Type 1 juvenile diabetes and leaky gut syndrome) than ever before. 
But following Dr. Paulâ€™s recommendations to feed a baby and small child a real food, whole foods diet, stop using Tylenol , and making judicious decisions about vaccination is too difficult?

Follow one-size-fits-all medicine as defined by the CDC and the AAP and watch your children spend the rest of their lives battling vaccine injury and chronic disease. 
Follow Dr. Paul Thomasâ€™ vaccine-friendly plan of avoiding toxins, eating real food, getting plenty of outdoor time and sunlight, and choosing to do judiciously spaced vaccines, one aluminum-containing shot at a time (or choosing no vaccines at all), and raise happy, healthy children. 
You decide.
