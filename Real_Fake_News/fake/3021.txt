TASS.COM 
Russia and China need to create an autonomous financial system which would be minimally subject to political risks and external pressure, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview with the Chinese Central Television (CCTV). 
â€œAs I see it, what should we be guided with in creating a modern financial system in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China and in the Russian Federation?â€ he said. â€œWe need to set up a modern, protected and simultaneously quite autonomous financial system, which would be subject to political risks to a lesser degree.â€ Nowadays, Russia and China are considering integration of Russiaâ€™s national payment system, the Mir bank cards, and Chinaâ€™s UnionPay system, he said. 
â€œIn our view, it would help to enhance the reliability of payments,â€ Medvedev said, adding that sometimes some countries were trying to exert â€œall sorts of political pressure.â€ European banks had been regularly fined by US financial authorities and financial companies, he added. 
â€œThey say â€We will take ten billion euros from a French bank and seven billion euros from a German bankâ€™. Our European partners agree with this,â€ Medvedev said. 
â€œI am not speaking about the nature of these disputes but that we must protect our financial systems. China must protect its own system and Russia must protect its own system. Therefore, this cooperation is very useful as in this situation no-one will be capable of blocking the road of financial traffic,â€ he emphasized. Russia looks to predictability of Chinaâ€™s economic growth 
Russia expects that Chinaâ€™s economic growth will be predictable and is set to cooperate with Chinese partners for the purpose, Russiaâ€™s Prime Minister said in an interview. 
â€œWe are interested in predictability of Chinaâ€™s economy growth and so we are ready to work with our Chinese partners,â€ Medvedev said, adding the Russian government was implementing a plan aimed to boost the economic growth. 
â€œActually, everyone needs it. Our country needs it as recently we have been plunged in a phase of such decline. Both European and US economies need it since they have not been gaining fast growth, to say nothing about Japan. Also, the Chinese economy needs it since it had been gathering speed in the past years but has slowed down later,â€ he said. â€œIt is closely watched by everyone as Chinaâ€™s economy is the most significant factor of the world economic growth.â€. Energy and high technology sectors 
Russia and China may reach the goal of $200bln trade by 2020 but energy and high technology sectors along with traditional trade should move up a gear, Russian Prime Minister said. 
â€œIndicators have been improving this year as a result of joint work of the two states, including our countriesâ€™ leaders, governments, ministries, agencies and businesses,â€ Medvedev said. Russia, China intend to develop small satellite for Wi-Fi network 
â€œI am convinced that if we move ahead like this, by 2020 we will be able to reach the trade of $200 billion worth. However, attention should be turned to key aspects of cooperation,â€ he said explaining he implied the energy sector, with some projects like the Power of Siberia gas pipeline. 
â€œIn 2015 construction of an eastern stretch of the gas pipeline was launched,â€ he said. â€œAlso, it includes oil supplies along the Skovorodino-Mohe (oil pipeline) extension and construction of large facilities, in particular the construction of Unit 3 at the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant.â€ 
Besides, high-tech projects should be enhanced, he said. 
â€œI mean wide-body jets, heavy helicopters and other projects in the high-tech sector,â€ Medvedev said. â€œIt seems to me that if we diversify trade like this, our countries will be quite capable of reaching the level which we agreed on several years ago,â€ he said in conclusion. Share
