â€She Wants To Be First Woman President For Selfish Reasonsâ€™ â€“ Macy Smit 
The Daily Sheeple â€“ Hillary Clinton canâ€™t even convince her own family members to vote for her. The only daughter of Bill Clintonâ€™s druggie brother explained to Radar Online that she will be voting for Donald Trump instead of her â€œselfishâ€ aunt. 
Macy Smit, a hairstylist from Tampa, Florida said, â€œI support Donald Trump â€” 100 percent! I have been a Democrat my entire life, but Trump is what we need right now â€” somebody who is going to stand up for us. I think at this point Hillary just wants it for the history books â€” to be the first woman president for selfish reasons.â€ 
Macyâ€™s husband Derrick Smit is a meteorologist with the US Air Force and is currently on active duty in Kuwait, where he assists with air operations into and out of Iraq. 
Macyâ€™s mother, Martha Spivey, agreed with her daughter about Hillary Clintonâ€™s selfish nature. In an interview with Radar, she said, â€œThe Clintons are all talk! Hillary says sheâ€™s all about family, but sheâ€™s got a niece sheâ€™s never met and never acknowledged. The Clintons have never helped us out.â€ 
Macy explained in the interview that her estranged father, Roger Clinton, makes a lot of promises that he never keeps. Does this sound familiar? SF Source The Daily Sheeple Nov. 2016 Share this:
