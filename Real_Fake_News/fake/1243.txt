Josh Fox on Dakota Access Pipeline Standoff: â€Where the F*** Is Hillary Clinton Right Now?â€™   CREDIT 
Filmmaker Josh Fox has a pretty good idea where Hillary Clinton is likely to be found starting Jan. 20. But before she makes her final play for the White House, Fox has a pressing question for the Democratic  . 
â€œWhere the fuck is Hillary Clinton right now?â€ Fox asked during his guest appearance on â€œLive at Truthdigâ€ at the siteâ€™s Los Angeles headquarters. 
That was more of a pointed question than a literal one, since anyone with a television or smartphone can easily track down where Clinton is making her latest campaign stump speech. 
More specifically, Fox, whoâ€™s a climate activist and playwright as well as the director of the Oscar-nominated documentary â€œGasland,â€ was wondering why Clinton wasnâ€™t anywhere near the contested grounds of North Dakota where the ongoing clash over the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a volatile point. 
  
Remarking that â€œwe all want to think that we would be on the right sideâ€ of history and that, for example, â€œif we were in Selma, we all would have marched with King,â€ Fox positioned Clinton squarely â€œon the wrong side of history right nowâ€ for maintaining a conspicuous silence about the DAPL battle. 
â€œYou cannot stand by when a racist occupying force that is run by the government of a rogue state is operating as an arm of the oil and gas industry, is attacking natives, is attacking protesters, is attacking people and torturing them in the ways that we saw in the Iraq War,â€ Fox said. â€œItâ€™s unacceptable.â€ 
Fox was equally unsparing about Clintonâ€™s environmental credentials. â€œHillary Clinton is not an environmentalist,â€ he said. â€œHillary Clinton is not adequate on climate change. And right now, sheâ€™s standing by while human rights abuses are unfolding in America where sheâ€™s running for president.â€ 
The director was making the media rounds to drum up support for the activists and members   allied protesters in North Dakota, some of whom faced off Thursday with police in riot gear as law enforcement and National Guard personnel forcibly removed protesters from their encampment near one of the pipelineâ€™s construction zones. He was also putting out the word about the plight of fellow filmmaker Deia Schlosberg, producer of his 2016 documentary â€œHow to Let Go of the World (and Love All the Things Climate Canâ€™t Change),â€ who was arrested and hit with conspiracy charges earlier this month while shooting footage of activists at a North Dakota tar sands pipeline. Schlosberg has been charged with three felonies and may face 45 years in prison.

â€œWe need to drop all the charges immediately, we need her footage backâ€”her footage was confiscated,â€ Fox said of Schlosberg. â€œWe definitely need an outcry and an outpouring of support for our journalists who are facing jail time for doing what is a constitutionally protected activity.â€ Fox has posted a videotaped statement about his colleagueâ€™s plight, as well as information about a petition, on this promotional site for his latest work. 
Despite his robust criticism of Clinton, Fox told Truthdigâ€™s Sarah Wesley, Emma Niles and Donald Kaufman that he was more concerned about the possibility of GOP nominee Donald Trump winning this election. Fox, who had supported Democratic candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and served on the Democratic platform committee at last summerâ€™s party convention, said he understood Sandersâ€™ reasons for backing the Democratic ticket: â€œIf Bernie Sandersâ€™ legacy was to contribute to the election of Donald Trump, I think his whole life would have been a failure.â€ 
As for Green Party   Jill Stein? â€œIâ€™m sorry. Itâ€™s immoral what sheâ€™s doing,â€ Fox said. â€œAnd I donâ€™t care if I say this on air for the very first timeâ€”I spent eight years building the environmental movement, I spent eight years coast-to-coast building the [anti-]fracking movement, I went to 250 cities. I did not see the Green Party having a significant hand in the building of that movement.â€
