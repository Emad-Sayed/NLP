  
President Obama is known for his humor, but his interview with Samantha Bee is downright hilarious. 
During his final days in office, Obama has been making rounds on talk shows. When he sat down with the host of Full Frontal this week, the result was simply priceless. 
Bee took a few shots at him for his age, asking if he would consider an appearance on Antique Roadshow and pointing out the white in his hair. Obama reminded her that he was still president, after all, but Bee was hell bent on making this an interview to remember. 
She finally asked Obama if he would â€œmessâ€ with Donald Trump once he was done serving as Commander in Chief. 
â€œAfter you leave office, have you thought of just whispering in Donald Trumpâ€™s ear, â€You were right, I wasnâ€™t born here,â€™ just to, like, mess with him?â€ Bee asked. 
â€œI think itâ€™s fair to say that I will be organizing my post-presidency where Iâ€™m not close enough to him to whisper into his ear,â€ Obama shot back. 
They did discuss some important issues, such as young voters and the struggles that Hillary Clinton may face as the first woman to serve as President of the United States. But the playful back and forth between President Obama and Bee is too funny to miss. It also reminds us just why it is that we are going to miss this man so much when he is gone.
