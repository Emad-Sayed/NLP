Everyone getting hammered tonight for bad reasons 11-11-16 
BRITAIN is to get hammered as usual tonight but for bad reasons, not celebratory, end-of-the-week ones. 
Alcohol is selling briskly across the UK as adults prepare to get blackout drunk not because the weekend is here but because the weekend is here and Donald Trump is president and Leonard Cohen is dead. 
Nikki Hollis, from Peterborough, said: â€œNormally Iâ€™m skipping merrily into the land of drunkenness, a carefree sense that none of it matters, but tonight Iâ€™ll be lurching there. 
â€œI wouldnâ€™t be surprised if I havenâ€™t killed two bottles of wine by 10pm in my despair, as opposed to last week when I polished off two bottles before News at Ten out of sheer joie de vivre. â€ 
She added: â€œAnd tomorrowâ€™s hangover will be a black cloud of gloom clearly revealing that everything in the world is shit. While last week it just seemed like that.â€ 
Pub landlord Bill McKay said: â€œWeâ€™re expecting a fairly dark atmosphere in here tonight. We probably wonâ€™t do the quiz.â€
