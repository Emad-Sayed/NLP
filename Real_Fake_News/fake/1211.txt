There have been plenty of stories of voter fraud across the country, but a photoshopped picture has taken the internet by storm. In it, Donald Trumpâ€™s name is left off of the ballot whil Hillary Clintonâ€™s is listed twice. 
The doctored photo hit Twitter and has since been re-tweeted tens of thousands of times. Take a look at the picture for yourself:

About an hour after John Laussier started the hoax, he took responsibility for it and admitted that it wasnâ€™t real: â€œIn case its not super obvious that last tweet from me is a hoax. Donâ€™t believe everything you read on the internet folks.â€ Is Trump on the Oregon ballot? YES. But a hoax grabbed a lot of retweets today.

â€œIâ€™m hoping people figure out soon this was fake, and, in the future, look at what theyâ€™re passing on,â€ Laussier told KATU . â€œWeâ€™ve got to act responsibly. Get out your ballots, take a good hard look, and vote with some research!â€ 
Laussier told KATU that it was â€œirresponsible of me to post the tweet,â€ and he apologized. LawNewz reported : 
The Oregon Secretary of Stateâ€™s Office told KGQ that they are evaluating whether the hoax violated election law. Spokesperson Molly Woon emphasized to the television station that the Oregon Secretary of State is â€œconfidentâ€ in the election process. 
While Laussier makes a good point about people being discerning about what they share on the internet, there are a couple of important points here. 
First, there is good reason for people to be vigilant about voter fraud . There are numerous reports of the problem across the country and itâ€™s good that people are paying attention. 
Second, the mainstream media is largely in the tank for Clinton and operates as a propaganda machine. Most people donâ€™t have the time â€” or if they do, donâ€™t have the resources â€” to thoroughly vet something they come across. You know who has both? The mediaâ€¦ but they refuse to do so because of their bias. 
If this ballot was real, people may have been able to force change by bringing light to what would have been a serious problem. 
That certainly doesnâ€™t mean that people shouldnâ€™t be discerning or that they should repost or re-tweet everything they come across. Thereâ€™s something to be said for people being vigilant, paying attention, and forcing those in the media and those in positions to do something about it to take a look. 
Now, that doesnâ€™t mean that people should automatically believe that somethingâ€™s true and adjust their beliefs/voting decision because of it; it just means that itâ€™s good that people are paying attention and forcing those in a position to check it out to do so. 
While Laussierâ€™s tweet was an interesting experiment, the timing was poor given the rampant voter fraud going on throughout the country. This was a hoax, but there are plenty of instances where it isnâ€™t, and people shouldnâ€™t be discouraged from being vigilant about it.
