From Campus Reform : Grinnell College (a private liberal arts college in Iowa) is promoting a guide to help students avoid â€œcultural appropriationâ€ this Halloween , warning that some costumes could be considered â€œdeplorable and problematic.â€ (Gee, wonder where they got the idea for the word â€œdeplorable?â€) 
The guide provides several examples of costumes that might fit the definition of â€œcultural appropriation,â€ defining the term as â€œthe act of displaying peopleâ€™s cultures in a disrespectful or condescending manner.â€ 
The guide, called â€œMy Identity, Not Your Costume,â€ goes on to list several examples of â€œoffensiveâ€ Halloween costumes, featuring pictures of Grinnell students holding photos of costumes that would be considered disrespectful towards their culture. 
In one instance, the guide shows a picture of a burly white man dressed in lingerie with a sash proclaiming â€œCall me Caitlyn,â€ referring to Caitlyn Jenner. The photo is held by a Grinnell student wearing a â€œNational Coming Out Dayâ€ pin, and includes a caption stating, â€œthe misrepresentation of my identity bothers me because people categorize me by my looks and may not understand my culture.â€ You just donâ€™t understand this cultureâ€¦ 
Another example of culturally appropriated Halloween costumes, according to the guide, is â€œusing other cultures as accessories to appear more hip/interesting without adequate understanding or permission ,â€ one example of which is a picture of someone dressed as a Hindu deity being held by an Indian student and the message that such costumes are â€œdeplorable and problematic.â€ 
It then warns students that if their costumes take â€œdefining characteristics of another cultureâ€ without â€œpermission , or understanding of the historical background behind the said culture,â€ then these costumes might be too offensive to wear. 
The guide then concludes with two questions the school thinks students should consider before selecting a Halloween costume, asking, â€œDoes your costume perpetuate stereotypes or inaccurately portray my culture as a joke?â€ as well as â€œWhy would I find your â€Halloween costumeâ€™ to be offensive?â€ 
Campus Reform reached out to Grinnell for a comment on the matter but did not receive a response in time for publication.
