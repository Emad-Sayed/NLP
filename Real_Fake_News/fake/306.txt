On Sunday Syrian state media said rebels had used chemical weapons against government-controlled districts of Aleppo. 

RT reports: 
Scores of civilians, including several children, were killed while hundreds of others were wounded in â€œrelentless and indiscriminateâ€ attacks carried out by opposition groups in the western districts of Aleppo, according to the UN statement. 
â€œThose who argue that this is meant to relieve the siege of eastern Aleppo should be reminded that nothing justifies the use of disproportionate, indiscriminate [attacks,] including heavy weapons on civilian areas and it could amount to war crimes,â€ de Mistura said. 
He echoed the condemnation voiced by the UN secretary-general regarding the attacks on schools. The special envoy also criticized the â€œuse of heavy airpower on civilian areas.â€ 
â€œThe civilians of both sides of Aleppo have suffered enough due to futile but lethal attempts of subduing the city of Aleppo,â€ he said. â€œThey now need and deserve a stable ceasefire covering this ancient city of Syria.â€ 
Earlier on Sunday, state news agency SANA reported that â€œshells containing poison gasesâ€ had been fired at the residential district of al-Hamdaniya in western, government-held Aleppo. 
RT Arabicâ€™s crew in Aleppo reported 36 cases of suffocation. Al-Mayadeen reported that all the victims of the attack are civilians. 
Just recently, the Russian Defense Ministry reported on a number of attacks in Aleppo that targeted schools and claimed the lives of at least three children in the period of 24 hours. Twelve more people died in an attack on a humanitarian aid corridor opened next to a school in the Al-Mashariq district, according to the ministryâ€™s information. Twelve more people were injured. 
Meanwhile, according to Russiaâ€™s Permanent Mission to the United Nations, over 16,000 people have fallen victim to opposition groups meant to be under US control. â€œFrom February to September, the opposition groups that are supposed to be under the US control committed 2,031 violations of the [cessation of hostilities], which claimed lives of 3,532 military personnel and 12,800 civilians,â€ the Missionâ€™s statement, published on the website of the Russian Foreign Ministry, reads. 
According to Dr. Said Sadek, professor of Political Sociology at the American University of Cairo, itâ€™s not likely that Western powers and the Gulf states will end their backing for rebel groups, even if they are found responsible for using chemical weapons in Aleppo. â€œWe have to understand that for six years, the Western countries and the Gulf states invested in those â€moderateâ€™ or radical groups, and so they cannot abandon them,â€ Sadek explained. â€œThey cannot pull out now and say, â€OK we discovered that we are wrong, letâ€™s get out and leave them.â€™ They have invested in them and they will still use them for bargaining in the future of Syria.â€
