Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer told CNNâ€™s Michael Smerconish Saturday that Huma Abedin signed an OF-109 disclosure form when she left the State Department in 2013, signifying she understood the â€œlegal obligationâ€ to â€œturn over all classified information and to further safeguard any further information that could be disclosed.â€ 
â€œLetâ€™s put this in context,â€ Spicer told Smerconish. â€œHillary Clinton initially said she turned over everything that was relevant. The only thing she didnâ€™t were emails regarding yoga and Chelseaâ€™s wedding.â€ 
â€œWe know that to be false.â€ 
â€œFurther, when Huma Abedin left the State Department they have to file a form of OF-109,â€ he continued. â€œItâ€™s a separation agreement that states simply people understand when leaving government that they are maintaining no classified information, they understand their legal obligation to protect further classified information and safeguard any potential disclosures of that.â€
