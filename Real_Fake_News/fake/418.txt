We have compiled a huge list of voter fraud incidents which were caught in the early voting process, all of it done by Hillary Clintonâ€™s supporters against Republican candidate Donald Trump.
So far there hasnâ€™t been a single case where Republicans were caught doing voter fraud for Donald Trump.
Remember the following list is a compilation of CAUGHT cases. Imagine how many more there might be out there uncaught.

â€“ Third-party Voters Are â€œTrading Votesâ€ With Clinton Voters To Defeat Trump
â€“ Democrats are suing Roger Stone on bogus charges of â€œvoter intimidationâ€ for only wanting to conduct AFTER -voting exit polling! Exit polling is not only legal but its something done in all civilized countries in the world. Democrats want to steal and prevent anyone from exposing their thievery. Exit polling provides perfectly accurate results and if in some state GOP gets for example 55% in exit polls and then 40% or whatever in final results, then we know there was fraud involved in that state. The usual accepted error between actual final results and exit polling canâ€™t be bigger than 2%.
