Republicans in Congress and perhaps across the nation are suffering today from a case of buyers remorse after Trump begins back peddling on several of his campaign promises, before he even takes office. 
Over the last few days, he backed off on his claim that heâ€™ll repeal Obamacare by saying heâ€™d just tweak it. Heâ€™s seemed to have changed his mind on prosecuting Hillary Clinton and heâ€™s no longer talking about banning Muslims. While â€œdrain the swamp,â€ which referred to Washingtonâ€™s culture of corruption, was one of his later campaign slogans, heâ€™s filling his cabinet posts with Washington insiders and corporate lobbyists. Heâ€™s even appearing to change his mind about his signature issue, the wall between the United States and Mexico . 
One piece of Trumpâ€™s campaign rhetoric was actually something that would make peopleâ€™s lives better and itâ€™s something that Republicans are going to hate. His proposal for student loans is radical, in that itâ€™s not a gift to Wall Street and itâ€™s even more liberal than anything President Obama has proposed. In a rally just a month ago, Trump said about student loans: 
â€œWe would cap repayment for an affordable portion of the borrowerâ€™s income, 12.5 percent, weâ€™d cap it. That gives you a lot to play with and a lot to do,â€ Trump said at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday. â€œAnd if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, weâ€™ll let them get on with their lives. They just go ahead and they get on with their lives.â€ 
â€œStudents should not be asked to pay more on the debt than they can afford,â€ Trump said. â€œAnd the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.â€

Trumpâ€™s proposed debt forgiveness program is actually pretty similar to Obamaâ€™s . Instead of a 12.5 percent cap, Obama introduced a cap of 10 percent of a graduateâ€™s income. Trumpâ€™s program, though, would leave graduates with five fewer years of debt. Trumpâ€™s would forgive debt after 15 years while Obamaâ€™s would forgive after 10. In that one significant way, Trumpâ€™s program is even more liberal than Obamaâ€™s and if he carries it out, Congressional Republicans may have no choice but to turn on their partyâ€™s President. 
The American Enterprise Institute is a Washington think tank who issues a lot of the marching orders of Republicans. They were the driving force behind the Iraq war and of failed trickle down economics. This is what they have to say about student loan debt forgiveness: 
â€œThey are way off on their numbers,â€ said Jason Delisle, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. â€œIf you were going to give loan forgiveness in 15 years, youâ€™re going to forgive a lot more debt than youâ€™re going to make up for in the form of the higher payments theyâ€™re proposing, by a lot. I donâ€™t even need to run the numbers. Itâ€™s so obvious.â€ 
Really, itâ€™s not obvious. Forgiving student debt would be a big boost to the economy because it would 1.) incentivize people to become more educated and 2.) put more money back into the economy because graduates would be free to buy more. Not that Republicans care about that, though. They prefer that graduates owe their lives to Wall Street banks and in turning his back on that, Trump is violating literally everything his party stands for.
