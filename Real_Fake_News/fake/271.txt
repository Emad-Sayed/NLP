Hillary Clintonâ€™s niece has revealed to Radar that she will be voting for Donald Trump next week. 
Macy Smit is the daughter of Bill Clintonâ€™s brother Roger. 
â€œSomething tells me the Clinton side of the family looks at me and my mother as not good enough, but weâ€™re hard-working!â€ she said. 
â€œI support Donald Trump â€” 100 percent! I have been a Democrat my entire life, but Trump is what we need right now â€” somebody who is going to stand up for us. I think at this point Hillary just wants it for the history books â€” to be the first woman president for selfish reasons.â€ 
Macy, a hairstylist in Tampa, is married to a meteorologist with the U.S. Air Force. Her husband is currently stationed in Kuwait coordinating operations in Iraq. 
â€œTheyâ€™re not as good as everyone thinks they are,â€ Macy said in reference to the Clintons. â€œI went through some very personal things [without their support],â€ she added, speaking of a miscarriage she suffered last year. 
â€œThe Clintons are all talk!â€ said Macyâ€™s mother, Martha. â€œHillary says sheâ€™s all about family, but sheâ€™s got a niece sheâ€™s never met and never acknowledged. The Clintons have never helped us out.â€ 
Even Hillary Clintonâ€™s own family canâ€™t stand herâ€¦
