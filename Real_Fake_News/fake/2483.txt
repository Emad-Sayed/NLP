In 2009, Anna Kendrick became a star. 
But it seems she wasn't quite prepared in terms of....anything. 
When the 31-year-old actress snagged a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her work in â€œUp In The Air,â€ it made her an instant A-lister. 
But while promoting her new memoir, â€œScrappy Little Nobody,â€ on the â€œEllen DeGeneresâ€ show Wednesday, Kendrick revealed that it all happened at a time when she was totally broke: 
â€œIt was this weird combination of, like, all these great things are happening but at the same time nothing has changed.â€ 
She describes how she had a hard time getting together a decent outfit for the Oscars: 
â€œMy stylist told me I had to wear the perfect shoes for an outfit, and because the movie isn't out yet, she said, 'Nobody really knows who you are. The shoe places don't want to loan you the shoes, so can you buy a pair of Louboutins?'â€ Image Credit: Simon & Schuster 
Kendrick laughed as she recalled being sent to New York to promote â€œUp In The Airâ€ alongside George Clooney and Vera Farmiga. 
She said being broke put her in an awkward position: 
"At one point I was like, 'If we do another trip to New York can you put me up in a less nice hotel room and then I could keep some of the cash?' And they were like, 'Ew no, this is not how this works!''' Image Credit: Screenshot/ YouTube 
Kendrick's memoir covers more hilarious moments of being â€œtoo poor,â€ in addition to moments that will stand out to her for the rest of her life - namely her recent duet with Justin Timberlake for their new film â€œTrollsâ€: 
â€œIt'll be, like, a career highlight for me. It was amazing watching him do his thing.â€ Image Credit: Screenshot/ YouTube 
â€œScrappy Little Nobodyâ€ is available now at bookstores, and â€œTrollsâ€ comes to theaters November 4th.
