Koch Brothers Secretly Allied w. George Soros for Hillary Clinton â†’ Jay Kurtz 
Why would Bernie supporters vote Clinton? Because if she wins, his movement will be finished, and she will see to it that it is. 
On the other hand, if Trump wins, Hillary is finished, and Bernie will become the driving force in the Democratic Party, and will crush Trump in 2020. 
I just donâ€™t understand why ANY Bernie supporter would be DUMB ENOUGH to vote for Hillary. gmatch 
There are many reasons not to vote for Hillary. Bernie is a proven fraud and should go away. If Trump wins â€“ the DNC will have to change or it will not survive. kimyo 
while weâ€™re talking about podesta emails, what is your interpretation of the following email from podesta re: a 2015 cnbc interview in which sanders stated â€œWhen you hustle money like that, you donâ€™t sit in restaurants like thisâ€ and â€œThat type of wealth has the potential to isolate you from the reality of the world.â€ 
podesta: This isnâ€™t in keeping w the agreement. Since we clearly have some leverage, would be good to flag this for him. I could send a signal via Welchâ€“or did you establish a direct line w him? 
my interpretation: you fell for sandersâ€™ schtick like an egg from a tall chicken. he was never for real. youâ€™ve been reporting on wrestlemania 2016 without comprehending that the whole thing is staged. 
you never said a single word about the theft of california, brooklyn and beyond. WHY? 
the word â€agreementâ€™, that doesnâ€™t raise any red flags for you? Donate
