in: General Health While cowâ€™s milk remains one of Americaâ€™s most common daily drinks, it is interesting to note that it may also be the reason why many Americans experience gas , bloating and other forms of indigestion. When the average cow is given growth hormones, antibiotics, GMO feed, vaccinations and exposed to toxic conditions, it is no wonder that many humans experience negative effects from consuming pasteurized cow milk . Goatâ€™s milk is a much healthier alternative, especially when it is raw and organic. Goats produce about 2% of the global milk supply and it is interesting that most of the populations of people who consume goat milks cite a lower incidence of allergies and digestive complaints. The Benefits of Goat Milk Goatâ€™s milk offers a wide variety of health benefits, with very few of the negative side effects of drinking regular cow milk. 1. Reaction to Inflammation Some research suggests that one of the main benefits of goat milk is that it may benefit inflammation. Another reason why it is easier for people with bowel inflammation to drink goatâ€™s milk, instead of cowâ€™s milk. 2. Environmentally Friendly Goats requires far less space and food than cows. Typically, you can comfortably raise six goats on the same acreage as two cows. 3. Metabolic agent Studies done at the USDA and Prairie View A&M University, link goatâ€™s milk to an increased ability to metabolize iron and copper, especially amongst individuals with digestion and absorption limitations. Besides drinking goatâ€™s milk, you can also take a digestive enzymes supplement to help with this also. 4. Bio-availability Another main health benefit of goat milk, is that it is closer to human motherâ€™s milk than cowâ€™s milk is. Because it has a chemical make up that is much closer to human milk, it is easier to digest and assimilate in the human body. 5. â€œSmallerâ€ Fat â€œSmallerâ€ fat? Does that mean it has less fat? Not necessarily, it means that the size of the fat molecules in goatâ€™s milk are much smaller than those found in cowâ€™s milk. This makes goatâ€™s milk easier to digest. 6. High in Fatty Acids While cowâ€™s milk has about seventeen percent fatty acids, goatâ€™s milk averages thirty five percent fatty acids, making it more nutritionally wholesome. In fact, up to 50% of people with lactose intolerance to cowâ€™s milk find that they can easily digest goatâ€™s milk, especially if it is raw. 7. Calcium-rich Many people worry that they need to drink cowâ€™s milk for calcium intake and the prevention of bone loss. Goatâ€™s milk also offers high amounts of calcium, the amino acid tryptophan, and much less side effects of drinking cowâ€™s milk. Itâ€™s just one of the many foods high in calcium . 8. Anti-Mucousal While drinking cowâ€™s milk is a common reason for allergies and excess mucous, goatâ€™s milk is not. Cowâ€™s milk is high in fat, which may increase mucous build-up. Moreover, the fat globules in goatâ€™s milk are one ninth the size of those found in cowâ€™s milk, another possible reason why it does not produce irritation in the gut. 9. Ultra-nourishing In Naturopathic medicine, goatâ€™s are referred to as bioorganic sodium animals. They are also associated with vigour, flexibility and vitality. Cows are calcium animals known for stability and heaviness. Bioorganic sodium is an important element in keeping joints mobile and limber. Goat milk has traditionally been used in medicinal cultures to nourish and regenerate an over-taxed nervous system. Goatâ€™s milk is also extremely nutrient dense. It has almost 35% of your daily needs for calcium in one cup. Extremely high in riboflavin, just one cup of goatâ€™s milk offers 20.0% of our daily needs. Add to that high amounts of phosphorous, Vitamin B12, protein and potassium. In fact, Ghandi himself rejuvenated his own health after extremely long periods of fasting through drinking raw goatâ€™s milk [ 1 ] . 10. Less toxic than Cowâ€™s Milk Whereas most cowâ€™s milk is pumped full of bovine growth hormones as well as a substance known as bovine somatotropin, a hormone specific for increasing milk production in an unnatural way, goatâ€™s are rarely treated with these substances. Because of its use on the fringes of big agriculture, goatâ€™s milk is not only more nutritious for you, but also less toxic. 11. May Boost Immune System Goatâ€™s milk has the trace mineral, selenium, a key essential mineral in keeping the immune system strong and functioning normally. Why You Should Drink Goat Milk Over Cowâ€™s Milk These are just a few of the many health benefits of goat milk. Not only does it contain more nutrients your body craves, but it also has less additives than cowâ€™s milk. Go with the healthier choice. References: Time Magazine.
