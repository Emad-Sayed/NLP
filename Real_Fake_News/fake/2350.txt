Why Are So Many People Choosing To Leave The United States Permanently?   August 11th, 2013 
Have things gotten so bad that it is time to leave the United States for good? That is a question that a lot of Americans are dealing with these days, and an increasing number of them are choosing to leave the country of their birth permanently. Some are doing it for tax reasons, some are doing it because they believe the future is brighter elsewhere, and others are doing it because they are very distressed about the direction that America is heading and they donâ€™t see any hope for a turnaround any time soon. Personally, I have several friends and contacts that regard themselves as â€œpreppersâ€ that have decided that the United States is too far gone to recover. They have moved their families out of the country and they never plan to return. As this nation continues to head down the very troubled road that it is currently on, this trend is probably only going to accelerate even more. 
In fact, some Americans are even going so far as to renounce their citizenship when they leave. This represents only a small percentage of those that are leaving the country, but as Bloomberg recently reported , the number of Americans that renounced their citizenship in the second quarter of 2013 was six times larger than the number that renounced their citizenship in the second quarter of last yearâ€¦ 
Americans renouncing U.S. citizenship surged sixfold in the second quarter from a year earlier as the government prepares to introduce tougher asset-disclosure rules. 
Expatriates giving up their nationality at U.S. embassies climbed to 1,131 in the three months through June from 189 in the year-earlier period, according to Federal Register figures published today. 
Renouncing the country of your birth is not an easy thing to do. From the moment that we come into this world, those of us born in this country are trained to think of ourselves as â€œAmericansâ€. The following is an excerpt from a recent article by Simon Black of the Sovereign Man blog â€¦ 
It doesnâ€™t matter where youâ€™re fromâ€“ the United States, Sweden, New Zealand, or Venezuelaâ€¦ many people all over the world are inculcated from birth with a sense that their country is â€betterâ€™ than all the others. 
We grow up with the songs, the flag waving, and the parades until the concept of motherland becomes deeply rooted in our emotional cores. 
Not to mention, when so many of our friends and neighbors unquestionably fall in line, itâ€™s a powerful social reinforcement that only strengthens the bond. 
We come to view our nationalities rather ironically as a big piece of our core individuality. I am an American. I am a Canadian. I am an Austrian. Instead ofâ€“ I am a human being. 
It has taken decadesâ€¦ centuries evenâ€¦ to reach this point. So the fact that more and more people are making the gut-wrenching decision to ditch their US passports is truly a powerful trend. 
Traditionally, the   been some of the most patriotic people on the face of the planet. 
So why are we now seeing such an increase in the number of people choosing to leave the United States permanently? 
Well, the truth is that there are a whole host of reasons why people are losing faith in this country and are deciding to leaveâ€¦ 
-The U.S. economy has been steadily declining for many years and that decline now seems to be accelerating. 
-We are being taxed into oblivion . 
-The quality of the jobs in our economy is rapidly declining . 
-Our culture is rapidly going down the toilet . 
-Our health care system has become a complete mess and a giant money making scam . Obamacare is only going to make things even worse . 
-Our politicians are tremendously corrupt, but the same clowns just keep getting sent back to D.C. over and over again. 
-Our nation seems to be on a relentless march toward collectivism . 
-America is rapidly turning into a â€œBig Brotherâ€ police state that is run by control freaks that seem obsessed with watching, tracking, monitoring and controlling virtually everything that we do. 
Of course the list above could go on indefinitely, but hopefully I have made my point. A whole lot of people out there are absolutely horrified as they watch what is happening to America, and leaving the country for good is increasingly being viewed as a potential option by many. 
But as tempting as â€œ going Galt â€ may seem, please come up with a good plan first. 
As one family recently discovered , hopping into a small boat and sailing off into the Pacific Ocean in search of a better life is probably not going to work out too wellâ€¦ 
A northern Arizona family that was lost at sea for weeks in an ill-fated attempt to leave the U.S. over what they consider government interference in religion will fly back home Sunday. 
Hannah Gastonguay, 26, said Saturday that she and her husband â€œdecided to take a leap of faith and see where God led usâ€ when they took their two small children and her father-in-law and set sail from San Diego for the tiny island nation of Kiribati in May. 
But just weeks into their journey, the Gastonguays hit a series of storms that damaged their small boat, leaving them adrift for weeks, unable to make progress. They were eventually picked up by a Venezuelan fishing vessel, transferred to a Japanese cargo ship and taken to Chile where they are resting in a hotel in the port city of San Antonio. 
Yes, life in America is definitely going to be extremely challenging in the years ahead, but the grass is not always greener on the other side of the planet either. 
There are a whole host of things to consider before you make a permanent move to another country. The following is an extended excerpt from one of my previous articles â€¦ 

The following are 10 questions to ask yourself before you decide to move to another countryâ€¦ 
Do You Speak The Language? If Not, How Will You Function? 
If you do not speak the language of the country that you are moving to, that can create a huge problem. Just going to the store and buying some food will become a challenge. Every interaction that you have with anyone in that society will be strained, and your ability to integrate into the culture around you will be greatly limited. 
How Will You Make A Living? 
Unless you are independently wealthy, you will need to make money. In a foreign nation, it may be very difficult for you to find a job â€“ especially one that pays as much as you are accustomed to making in the United States. 
Will You Be Okay Without Your Family And Friends? 
Being thousands of miles away from all of your family and friends can be extremely difficult. Will you be okay without them? And it can be difficult to survive in a foreign culture without any kind of a support system. Sometimes the people that most successfully move out of the country are those that do it as part of a larger group. 
Have You Factored In Weather Patterns And Geological Instability? 
As the globe becomes increasingly unstable, weather patterns and natural disasters are going to become a bigger factor in deciding where to live. For example, right now India is suffering through the worst drought that it has experienced in nearly 50 years . It would be very difficult to thrive in the middle of such an environment. 
Many of those that are encouraging people to â€œescape from Americaâ€ are pointing to Chile as an ideal place to relocate to. But there are thousands of significant earthquakes in Chile each year, and the entire nation lies directly along the â€œRing of Fireâ€ which is becoming increasingly unstable. That is something to keep in mind. 
What Will You Do For Medical Care? 
If you or someone in your family had a serious medical problem in the United States, you would know what to do. Yes, our health care system is incredibly messed up , but at least you would know that you could get the care that you needed if an emergency arose. Would the same be true in a foreign nation? 
Are You Moving Into A High Crime Area? 
Yes, crime is definitely on the rise in the United States. But in other areas where many preppers are moving to, crime is even worse. Mexico and certain areas of Central America are two examples of this. And in many foreign nations, the police are far more corrupt than they generally are in the United States. 
In addition, many other nations have far stricter gun laws than the United States does, so your ability to defend your family may be greatly restricted. 
So will your family truly be safe in the nation that you plan to take them to? 
Are You Prepared For â€œCulture Shockâ€? 
Moving to another country can be like moving to a different planet. After all, they donâ€™t call it â€œculture shockâ€ for nothing. 
If you do move to another country, you may quickly find that thousands of little things that you once took for granted in the U.S. are now very different. 
And there is a very good chance that many of the â€œamenitiesâ€ that you are accustomed to in the U.S. will not be available in a foreign nation and that your standard of living will go down. 
So if you are thinking of moving somewhere else, you may want to visit first just to get an idea of what life would be like if you made the move. 
What Freedoms and Liberties Will You Lose By Moving? 
Yes, our liberties and our freedoms are being rapidly eroded in the United States. But in many other nations around the world things are much worse. You may find that there is no such thing as â€œfreedom of speechâ€ or â€œfreedom of religionâ€ in the country that you have decided to move to. 
Is There A Possibility That The Country You Plan To Escape To Could Be Involved In A War At Some Point? 
We are moving into a time of great geopolitical instability. If you move right into the middle of a future war zone, you might really regret it. If you do plan to move, try to find a country that is likely to avoid war for the foreseeable future. 
When The Global Economy Collapses, Will You And Your Family Be Okay For Food? 
What good will it be to leave the United States if you and your family run out of food? 
Today, we are on the verge of a major global food crisis. Global food reserves are at their lowest level in nearly 40 years , and shifting global weather patterns are certainly not helping things. 
And the global elite are rapidly getting more control over the global food supply. Today, between 75 and 90 percent of all international trade in grain is controlled by just four gigantic multinational food corporations. 

Leaving the United States permanently and setting up a new life in another country can be done, but it isnâ€™t for the faint of heart. It takes planning, preparation and lots of hard work. 
However, there are lots of people that have done it successfully, including quite a number of people that I know personally. 
In the end, you have got to make the decision that is right for you and your family. Donâ€™t let anyone else tell you what to do. 
For many, staying in the United States and preparing for the tough years that are coming is the best choice. For others, getting out   and heading for greener pastures is the right choice. 
What about you?

Are These The Last Days Of The U.S. Marine Corps? » Rodster 
Iâ€™m sticking it out. As screwed up as America is iâ€™ll take my chances here. As the article mentioned, when the global economy collapses it may be harder to survive in another country. ian 
no. it will probably be easier, as most other nations dont have gun toting nutjobs and a less self centered view of life. Other countries may adopt a â€œweâ€™re all in this togetherâ€™ mentality, while america will, at first, descends into â€me firstâ€™ chaos. MeMadMax 
Take ur statement, and make it the opposite, and less hateful, and it would be right. Vindicare 
Guess what, no one is entitled to positive feelings. Hate is a feeling, nothing more. People may hate you, but you live in west, where you must feel good about others, whatever stupid and evil they are. Positive=!good, negative=!bad. And to tell the truth people often earn hate, they own it they. Yes hate may be rightfully earned. Hate is just waste of time, contempt is better, indifference is best. sherpeace 
Exactly. The people you hate donâ€™t care! The hate only hurts the hater! So, go for it; Keep on hating. Then you will die young, either from a heart attack or because the object of your hate kills you. Hooray! Now we will be rid of you! (Sorry, I know that is not very peaceful of me, but I couldnâ€™t help it.) Vindicare 
Stop projecting. I hate no one but mosquitoes. Usual Yada yada yada! Whatever I may sound to you when I go from keyboard it stop bothering me. Some people write things because they think, not because feel something. This western paranoia is pathetic. FEELINGS, FEWWINGS, FEEL, HURR DURR! Nop prefer logic. condaggitt 
Ian most other countries dont have mass quantities of violent black thugs either. xander cross 
Most countries have violent white men with guns. Just look at the white supremacist groups and people like Alex jones. Most white people are racist and evil by nature SVD 
Takes one to know one eh!? xander cross 
You would know. A racist like yourself is common in the land that you stole from us. Ted 
Just admit that you hate White peopleâ€¦which by definition makes you a racist! Oh the horror Thereâ€™s nothing worse than racismâ€¦oh no sherpeace 
People are offended by the white comment, but not the black one. That means YOU are racist. I am white, but I am offended by BOTH comments. You can not make blanket statements about ANY race. It is just unfair and wrong! Graham 
Your last sentence would lead a reader to believe you are of â€œAmerican Indianâ€ decent. Is that correct? 
If so, Iâ€™m interested in what tribe you are affiliated with, assuming that is something you are happy to share. Joe Jakkerton 
Im American Indian and can tell Xander is African. SVD 
Oh you hurt my feelings. I think Iâ€™m about to shed a tear. Get over yourself loser! xander cross 
The loser is the white man that enjoys selling his land to china for a currency that rapidly loosing its value. White men are the problem, that is why theyâ€™re marring (or stealing) Asian women in mass droves. sherpeace 
Oh, brother, come on! The things that ignorant people say just amazes me! Joe Jakkerton 
Thats makes us the WINNERS ha ha ha! DuchessLazy 
Why do so many Chinese murder their baby girls ? Itâ€™s a horror. Jill Ellen Schulze 
you are really really stupid. You are the reason I want to leave this country. People like you are still kept alive Walt Lonsdale 
We donâ€™t even know what you are BrianLandon 
right. stole from you, eh? so show us the deed? Joe Jakkerton 
Then move back to Africa and get on with it. Walt Lonsdale 
IS that why there is considerably more black on black crime??Idiot! sherpeace 
It is because there is considerably more poverty in black neighborhoods. And, I am sorry to say, that has a lot to do with the quality of schools. If you were to check, most successful blacks went to white schools, the only place to get an equal education despite â€œBrown vs. the board of educationâ€. Son Goku 
Most White AmeriKKKans are psychotic sociopaths. Blacks are on their sick demonic minds 24/7. This article had nothing to do with blacks. If Anglo Americans were so peaceful. Why do they have missile defense systems around China, Russia, and Iran. They are the real thugs. sherpeace 
Got a point there. Just remember that not all of us believe in what our govt. is doing. carnac123 
SG Because we are smart and we defend ourselves. Youâ€¦however are just a racist calling others racist. If America was all Anglo or at least all white,.. it would be a paradise. Joe Jakkerton 
Who said we were peaceful? We are violent and always have been. Oline Wright 
Not so, that statement is as racist as saying most blacks are violent thugs. There are good and bad in all peoples and it is high time we stop stereotyping people because of the color of their skin or even the place they grew up. DuchessLazy 
Try living in a an area where the majority is black and see what you get. Mondobeyondo 
Violent white men take over countries with guns. Violent black men take over inner cities with guns. 
We are ALL under attack!!! Linda Williams 
Who told you that? RalphZiggy 
what nonsense you spew, when did Alex Jones ever do or say anything racist? he has even demonstrated against hate groups like the KKK. In the USA, white people huge the majority of weapons but donâ€™t commit most of the crime. You are a white-hating racist, the supremacist full of hate is in your bathroom mirror. xander cross 
During the trayvon Martin trail. He and his supporters are indeed racist just like Ron and pans Paul are. His supports are really the same people that go to stormfront site as well. Alex jones never demonstrated against the kkk, but he demonstrated against black people several times. But then again, he gets paid by white men to be an idiot on television so, you defending him proves my point. RalphZiggy 
It is a fact Alex Jones demostrated against the KKK in Waco Tx in 1999 with a bullhorn, look it up. There are videos of it. You make up an world between your ears and believe in it, without letting facts get in the way of your prejudices Joe Jakkerton 
oh man you must be Lacquer head. I bet you love your caurborator cleaner. BrianLandon 
uh right. sort of like the blacks killing blacks in Africa? Or how about Muslims killing Muslims in Pakistan, Syria, Lebanon, etc. And how about the fact that the biggest rate of murders in the US is committed by young black men killing other young black men. 
the only racist here is yOU! xander cross 
No, white men are the racist and white men commit the most crimes and theyâ€™re not convicted for the murders that they commit. White men commit the most crimes and you use fake percentage numbers to spew your lies about black people. Letâ€™s talk real numbers, not fake percentages that you get from world net daily. DuchessLazy 
Lies. Whites actually care about THEIR neighborhoods and gladly get rid of criminals. Butâ€¦if youâ€™re rich, no matter the skin color, youâ€™re likely to get away with about anything. Joe Jakkerton 
All colored people are evil and racist. xander cross 
White men are evil and racist and to add to your stupidity, you white men turned a third world country to an economic superpower (China). Elliot 
â€œMost white people are racist and evil by natureâ€? Are you serious? That is such an ignorant statement with zero credibility. That is a stupid as if I were to say, â€œThere arenâ€™t any nations in this world governed by black people from top to bottom that dominate on the world stage, therefore all black people are stupid and lazyâ€. Look at the Chinese and India. They arenâ€™t white, are two of the most populated countries in the world, are HUGE players in our world economy, and yet both pollute the Earth daily like never before seen, and China executes more people annually (with a gun to the back of the head) than any other country worldwide. Yet you tell me they are full of â€œviolent white men with gunsâ€? You are what is wrong with our society. There are too many dumba$$e$ like you able to post their uneducated, idiotic opinions online and somehow garner steam from it. Some other dumba$$ will read your comment and give it a â€œthumbs upâ€ without realizing how stupid you both are. The problem with our societies is that the dumb people outnumber the smart ones 100 to 1, and whether you are black, white or rainbow-colored, you are an IDIOT. d 
What? Son Goku 
Dude!!! Why are you racist bigots obsess with black people?!?! This is one of the reason why people dislike white Americans around the world. Plus you bomb other peopleâ€™s countries for natural resources. You are the real thugs. Most of You people are obsess with race. Oline Wright 
again it is not about color or race it is truly more about who or what is in power. ANd frankly as an American I have to say I have not been that satisfied by the government that is supposed to represent me for the last 20 years or so. xander cross 
Stop lying because the white people on this site is openly racist. White men are the problem and every white person on this site supported stop and frisk by mayor Bloomberg. mikeymike61 
neegrows be da prolem, git rid a neegrows and you gots rid a 85% a da krime Tobias Smith 
you are clearly a racist foolish little boy sherpeace 
Oh, EVERYONE, huh? You got a lot of nerve speaking a lie like that! Joe Jakkerton 
Hey we only supported stop and frisk of coloreds and gays like you. sherpeace 
Longer than that, for me. Carter was the last true humanitarian in power in this country. Linda Williams 
Carter was an idiot. The interest rate soared under Carter. sherpeace 
Wow, you must be one of the most intelligent people on earth to be able to call a man like carter an idiot! Or you are a tea party Republican who hates all Democrats. lunchbox 
first of all, tea is delicious, but let me just say that is not a reference to politics, i just like tea. Especially irish breakfast tea. Secondly, you should all take the time to go back to the top of this page and re-read all of your comments. I would be interested to see if anyone can come up with a sensible answer as to how the discussions went from being about the government, and what is wrong with it. Tell me how the conversation shifted from discussing how to solve a very real problem to being concerned with racism, which is and always will be an issue as long as there is mankind. We can solve that problem later, that problem is not what will be destroying ours, or anyone elses country. Please stay focused on the matter at hand, or it will pass you by while you stand idly in oblivion. Mankind is but a petty child, given shoulders with which to carry the weight of the world. So please let us stop being petty, and use those shoulders to lift each other up to a point where we no longer need the guidance of govt.. We are after all the people that they are referencing when they say that govt. is for the people, by the people. Joe Jakkerton 
Carter was and still is an idiot. You sound like one of them Teaophobes. sherpeace 
You do have a point, but that is a very small minority of white American males. Most of us are peace loving people who lived in mixed neighborhoods and get along with everyone. My husband has been a teacher for 28 years at the same school. Everyone knows where he lives and no one bothers us. Oooops, my hubby isnâ€™t white. Only I am. I guess that explains it, huh? Fed Up With Your Ignorance 
Youâ€™re such an ignorant fool. GOVERNMENTS bomb other countries, and news flash, AMERICAâ€™S PRESIDENT IS BLACK. Have a nice dayâ€¦ Joe Jakkerton 
Or any other kinds of thugs. Alex 
Forget the black thugs. The problem is the scum bag wall street banksters who have destroyed our society while accomulating wealth. Jill Ellen Schulze 
you serious? You want to leave because of â€œblack thugs?â€. The biggest problem here is the government and in case you havenâ€™t noticed by watching fox news ( i am sure thatâ€™s what you watch), most are white besides the pres (luckily!) and they are not the â€œblack thugsâ€ you speak about. Ray J Cimbalnik 
I agree. Americans will only care about themselves. I can not wait to expatriate OUT of America. America will never recover UNTIL it falls COMPLETELY and then rebuilds. Oline Wright 
I have to disagree. Again it is an oversimplification of the attitudes of the country and a stereotype. Many in the US if they have it to spare will send money to help out countries in crisis due to catastrophic events. People will do so even within the country. It is more a case of the government overreaching its stated powers and becoming diametrically opposed to what the founding fathers envisioned. I have to admit that when a person is struggling to meet the day to day needs of their lives they will frequently become more centrally focused. But I think you will see similar attitudes in other countries as well. sherpeace 
You said it! Thank you! Boy, thank God when I went to El Salvador in the 80s, they understood that the govt. is NOT the people. I guess they knew because of their F*#@ed up govt. Joe Jakkerton 
Why not just leave the city? Joe Jakkerton 
I would appreciate it if you just stayed in the USA where you belong. Alex 
I decided to abandon ship. Humans have the right to survive, that has nothing to do with being an American. I am not the property of the USA, although they may think I am. America is not going to change, it is essentially dead with a few exceptions. Once you start disconnecting from this fake American society it will become easier to assimilate to another. In the US we have been spoiled and brainwash that we are number 1 because we have more material possessions then the rest of the world. If this was the case why are the majority of Americans unhappy. Although it is challenging to move to another country, I believe it can be done if one has the will. I left the states about almost 3 months ago and there is not a day that I regret it. Even though I have the advantage of speaking spanish, it still it is a challenge. Even though I may be broke atleast I am free and that you cannot put a price on. Lingram90 
Where did u relocate to? T 
Yes, but which ones? Can you name them? NoSheDidnâ€™t! 
I agreeâ€¦no matter where you are, all countries will get hit one way or the otherâ€¦eventuallyâ€¦especially those developing countries that depend on the 1st world countriesâ€¦compliments of: globalization! Vindicare 
It is other way around in case of USA. USA depend on import as it had outsourced the industry. It depends on dollar as reserve currency. And depend on military. sherpeace 
Sad, but true. Reality_Seeker 
It will be harder to survive in another country. Moreover, the global economy is going to collapse; and when it does, it will be open season on amerikansâ€¦â€¦.amerikans will be stripped of whatever they have, and in some cases, their lives will be taken, too. Think about your future before you try and run, because you can run but you might not be able to hide. dishatin 
There with ya nicho12 
I think it will be harder to survive in America if the global economy collapses. Think about it, America is full of different races all fighting each other to get ahead which creates too much hatred and anger among the races. An economic collapse will lead to a civil war in America and millions of people will die, especially the minorities, the you add in feminism which has caused many men to resent women, you have a multicultural chaos. Most people donâ€™t think about the social problems that America is facing. At least in other countries, their cultures are much more homogeneous and thereâ€™s less individualism than in America. In America, it will be itâ€™s every man for himself Mudpie 
I have lived abroad once and loved the nation but I will say living there for good would be hard. When everything and everyone â€“ including close family, some of whom are ill â€“ you know is in the U.S.A. There are great places out there, but as Michael notes, money issues are significant as well. Unless seriously loaded, you gotta work. Many nations discriminate against foreigners in the job market. And do not underestimate local connections that you lack, etc. Very hard to accomplish. Of course, most Americans have family forefathers who came from elsewhere and survived. It takes a VERY spiritual outlook to endure the privations until one is comfortable. Also, America discriminates against expatriots and the U.S.A. tax system for foreign earned income is insane and impossible to understand for most people. 
Michael hits the nail on the head when he says the grass is NOT always greener. 
We may do it again when our children get old enough to live on their own. But for the time being, I think that hunkering down and planning smartly here may be the way to go over time. Travel to those other amazing places. But feather the nest here, live in the state of your dreams and find a city that you are really into. I like New Mexico, for instance, and places therein. Alaska is like a foreign country for the so inclined. 
Honestly, if the U.S. goes to hell then most of the world will go with it, at least S. America and Central America. And at least here your neighbors who are sympathetic to your cause and freedom will be locked and loaded. In many places only bad guys have guns. 
Of course there will be violence here as the Al Sharpton haters pour into the streets. But you will have a chance. 
And those liberty lovers in your area . . . .do not forget Americans DO tend to be very smart people. Even in other really great countries, there are even more socialists than here (though some seem to manage it better, for at least a while). Americans who believe in liberty are the best on the planet. 
Let us hope we get a state that secedes and serves as a magnet for free men an women. MeMadMax 
NOT. My wife is from Guatemala, her mom finally got a hot water heater, the place canâ€™t go to hell because there is nothing to break. That is the extreme end of it, but itâ€™s the same thing. The world is not dependent on us for anything, except for one thing: Doing their dirty work for themâ€¦. If you think the world thinks about the US all the time, think again. We are like the prissy little cheerleader in highschool who thinks the school would close if she ever stopped going to schoolâ€¦. Mudpie 
Dude, I pretty much agree. I like the cheerleader analogy. We are full of ourselves and now it is coming out of our rearsâ€¦ Dmmonypeny@att.net 
It is probably best to stay in this country until the riots start. Even then you may want to make your first move out of the cities to a romote easily protected rural farming area. As bad asthe US is, a lot of the world is already in even worse shape. 
As banks fail and markets crash, you might want to start hunting for another country. I am looking at the Caymen Islands or Balese. 
I am steadily building a supply of gold and silver. I am also starting to take my money steadily out of the markets. I am also taking cash out of the bank. 
There is really no good reason to leave cash in your account. The highest probability of theft comes from the banks Rodster 
Exactly, just look at the conditions of countries like Greece, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Egypt, Portugal, Brazil. These are some of the places experiencing riots and unrest due to economic condition. 
As things global economy continues to get worse, those places will probably experience more unrest and violence. We havenâ€™t seen it here because our monetary policy is whatâ€™s driving the worldâ€™s economy. 
So when the SHTF expect chaos around the world. If you are Jim Rodgers, George Soros or a very wealthy person who can buy protection and a place that can insulate itself from turmoil then it really doesnâ€™t matter where you live. 
The world has never seen the potential for financial armageddon. So if and when it hits itâ€™s going to be ugly wherever you live. Prophecy2008 
Where do you put the cash to be safe if not in the bank? What about Paypal? Sergi William 
I was born in Spain and I am 100% Spanish. I spent 3 months in DC at 2011 and I totally agree with Michael: I had a culture shock. 
About the language, even if you know the language of the country you are moving to, it takes many years to get all the slang and to have a correct spelling and knowledge of everything about that country. 
And wellâ€¦ I feel sad because I came back to Spain and I always thought it was a mistake and I should stay in the US. 
But with the last news and everything, maybe I did the right thingâ€¦ 
Anyway, the whole view is so scaryâ€¦ 
Greetings from Barcelona to everybody! Rodster 
Greetings and yeah itâ€™s tough everywhere you live we cause this collapse is being planned on purpose. Itâ€™s better to live within oneâ€™s culture. Iâ€™m spanish but born and raised in the US. I know even for me it would be hard to move to a latin american country or to Spain. The culture is so different. jacklohman 
Mainly the rich will gather their stash and look for a country where it will be protected. But they will have to worry about pirates, or a corrupt security crew, or local politicians who will claim the cash as illegally acquired and confiscate it. Better that they stay in America and fix the system. Gracie Darling 
You are mostly wrong about that. Most countries in South America and Central America are no pirates or will take you money! 
The banks in South America have
