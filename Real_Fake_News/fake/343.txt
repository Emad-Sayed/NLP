https://web.archive.org/web/20161109183253/http://www.huffingtonpost.com They pretend Trumpâ€™s win is a victory for bigots, instead of a defeat for the aristocracy (â€Wall Streetâ€™, â€The Establishmentâ€™, or Americaâ€™s billionaires and their agents such as lobbyists and the leading politicians). However, a close look at the evidence shows Huffington Post to be wrong: Trumpâ€™s win was overwhelmingly driven by Americansâ€™ repudiation of the aristocracy itself (such as, for example, repudiation of the Institute that runs Huffington Postâ€™s neoconservative international edition, World Post , the Berggruen Institute (including Eric Schmidt , Lawrence Summers , Fareed Zakaria , Arianna Huffington, Nicholas Berggruen , Ernesto Zedillo , Carl Bildt, Niall Ferguson, and Joseph Nye , all being proponents of Obamaâ€™s building war against Russia â€” such as : â€œTo confront Putin, Europe will have to make changes that will be deeply controversial on a continent long committed to environmentalism and marked by an aversion to the use of forceâ€). And, as far as global warming is concerned, which is a real problem about Trump, itâ€™s also very much and demonstrably â€” not merely in words â€” a real problem about Hillary too (and one that outside the context of the Presidential campaign has even been courageously reported by some of HuffPoâ€™s own reporters ), but HuffPo and other Democratic Party propagandists pretend thereâ€™s reason to believe that Trumpâ€™s actions would be even worse than hers have been, and HuffPoâ€™s readers thus end up being little else than Democratic Party suckers who feel satisfied in their â€newsâ€™ reading to soak up what is almost entirely Democratic Party propaganda, which means the propaganda emanating out of the White House whenever a Democrat resides there â€” sort of like a Democratic Party version of the Republican Partyâ€™s Fox â€Newsâ€™. The aristocracy ( all of it, both its Republican and its Democratic Party branches) continue their campaign, and expect to crush their opposition â€” the public (of all parties). And thatâ€™s what a close look at the evidence shows explains Trumpâ€™s win â€” not bigotry on the part of the American public. Bigotry is a huge problem in every society, but especially amongst the aristocracy, who love to pretend that itâ€™s mainly a problem â€down belowâ€™ â€” so that they can continue to exploit the public while claiming to be superior to it. Thatâ€™s the Big Lie, which Obama and the Clintons â€” and Huffington Post â€” promote and get paid very well to promote. Their campaign never ends. Only the personnel do.
