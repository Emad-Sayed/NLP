Donald Trump promises to pardon Snowden, Assange, and Manning By Kilgoar , on November 13th, 2016 Donald Trump pardons American Heroes 
THE SWAMP â€” Sunday evening at a Republican fundraising dinner in Washington DC, Donald Trump promised to pardon Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, and Chelsea Manning. 
Speaking to the group of neoconservative elites, Trump said, â€œThese are people who have done good things, heroic things for America. Heroes. Meanwhile the Mexicans are rewarded with citizenship for having babies on our land, illegally. I think we need to change things around a bit, deny citizenship to all Mexicans forever. But first thingâ€™s first, weâ€™re going to build the wall.â€ 
Trump even suggested he is considering appointing Snowden and Assange to positions in his cabinet, saying, â€œThese are smart, smart people. Just look at what theyâ€™ve done for us already. Why are we going after them, rather than asking for their help? Think about it. If we spent as much time going after ISIS as we spend on them â€” well there wouldnâ€™t have ever been an ISIS. I might hire them. 
â€œHillaryâ€™s emails were a disaster. Total. Disaster. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m going to get Snowden be my Cyber General. Iâ€™m going to go to war on hackers and secure our computers. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I love computers. But ISIS uses computers a lot, and we must be vigilant.â€ 
â€œAssange, he knows so much. So so much. If anyone can help me to drain the swamp, itâ€™s Assange. I think heâ€™d make a great secretary of state.â€
