  
The Democratic National Committee just hauled Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee into a federal court demanding that they cease the program of minority voter intimidation that Trump has inspiring his supporters to carry out. The DNCâ€™s lawyers asked a New Jersey federal judge to hold the Republican Party in contempt for violating a 35-year old consent decree to enforce the Voting Rights Act, and to issue an injunction to enforce the terms of the agreement, which will force Republicans to cease their efforts to suppress votes in minority communities during this yearâ€™s general election. The DNC lawyers cited Donald Trumpâ€™s frequent statements to supporters, as well as one of vice presidential nominee Mike Penceâ€™s speeches where he admitted that the RNC was directly coordinating â€œballot integrityâ€ initiatives, which are explicitly banned under the agreement. 
Trumpâ€™s overt actions to call his supporters to watch polls in â€œcertain areasâ€ are a classic attempt to concoct an illegal â€œballot security program,â€ which is why we exclusively predicted this lawsuit could happen three weeks ago. Last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) weighed in with an op-ed published in the Washington Post urging the party to take action. This week, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump also took it upon themselves to lodge a new FBI complaint , over Trumpâ€™s voter suppression campaign which violates the same Voting Rights Act provisions covered by this recent DNC action which could land Republicans involved in the illegal campaigning â€“ like Roger Stone â€“ in criminal court. However, the Democratic Partyâ€™s action is based on a legal decision, so itâ€™s going to be expedited in court, and is likely to yield a rapid order from the federal judge against the Republican party and Trump. 
Hereâ€™s a summary of what the DNCâ€™s lawyers filed in federal court today: (see below for complete document ) 
Defendant Republican National Committee (â€œRNCâ€) has violated the Final Consent Decreeâ€¦ by supporting and enabling the efforts of the Republican candidate for President, Donald J. Trump, as well as his campaign and advisors, to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the 2016 Presidential Election. Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be â€œriggedâ€ based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in â€œcertain areasâ€ or â€œcertain sectionsâ€ of key states. 
Unsurprisingly, those â€œcertain areasâ€ are exclusively communities in which large minority voting populations reside. Notwithstanding that no evidence of such fraud actually exists, Trump has encouraged his supporters to do whatever it takes to stop itâ€”â€œYouâ€™ve got to get everybody to go out and watch . . . and when [I] say â€watch,â€™ you know what Iâ€™m talking about, right?â€â€”and has been actively organizing â€œelection observersâ€ to monitor polling stations in â€œcertain areas.â€ Trump has even encouraged his â€œwatchersâ€ to act like vigilante law enforcement officers. 
Although certain RNC officials have attempted to distance themselves from some of the Trump campaignâ€™s more recent statements, there is now ample evidence that Trump has enjoyed the direct and tacit support of the RNC in its â€œballot securityâ€ endeavors, including the RNCâ€™s collaboration on efforts to prevent this supposed â€œriggingâ€ and â€œvoter fraud.â€ 
In a rally in Denver, Colorado, on August 3, 2016, Trumpâ€™s vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, admitted that the RNC was directly coordinating with the Trump campaign on â€œballot integrityâ€ initiatives, stating that â€œthe Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee are working very very closely with state governments and secretaries of states all over the country to ensure ballot integrity.â€ 
The RNCâ€™s support of Trumpâ€™s efforts to recruit â€œwatchersâ€ who are intended to intimidate voters at their polling places violates this Courtâ€™s Consent Decree as modified in 2009, which explicitly forbid the RNC from engaging in so-called â€œballot securityâ€ measures directly, indirectly, or through its agents or employees. The RNCâ€™s conduct also violates the Consent Decree under well settled law prohibiting defendants from evading court orders by acting in concert with third parties. 
Donald Trumpâ€™s master of dirty tricks, Roger Stone is specifically named in the complaint because is the very same political operative, whose minority voter intimidation tactics landed the Republican party in hot water for 35 years in the first place for rigging a close New Jersey gubernatorial election! (which was won by the GOP candidate) 
Roger Stone, one of Trumpâ€™s top advisors, has amplified Trumpâ€™s message. Stone was a key advisor to the 1981 campaign of former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, in which a â€œballot securityâ€ force wearing black armbands engaged in widespread voter intimidation in Newark, Camden, Paterson and other minority neighborhoods in the State, leading to this very action and the Consent Decree that Stone is helping to violate today. 
Stone is currently running a website called â€œStopTheSteal.orgâ€ that is actively signing up Trump supporters to â€œvolunteerâ€ to fight â€œvoter fraud.â€ #StopTheSteal is a popular hashtag among Trump supporters on Twitter, and Stoneâ€™s group maintains an active Facebook presence. On October 23, 2016, Stone sent out a (now deleted) message via his Twitter feed deliberately designed to mislead Democratic voters by representingâ€”using Secretary Hillary Clintonâ€™s likeness and logoâ€”that supporters can â€œVOTE the NEW way on Tues. Nov 8thâ€ by texting â€œHILLARY to 8888,â€ after which voters would apparently â€œreceive official confirmation. 
Even worse, Roger Stone is trying to hide his voter suppression plan behind the facade of exit polling. DNC lawyers slammed the lunatic Republican political operative for his deception, and the court could order him to jail for contempt of court for his behavior. 
Stone is also using social media to promote the common plan that Trump supportersâ€”and particularly those who have agreed to engage in vigilante â€œballot securityâ€ effortsâ€”wear red shirts on Election Day. Further Stone is actively recruiting Trump supporters for â€œexit polling,â€ specifically targeting nine Democratic-leaning cities with large minority populations. This â€œexit pollingâ€ serves no legitimate purpose: Stone does not run a polling operation. Rather, the plain purpose of this plan is to intimidate minority voters. 
If Donald Trump does not cease his open calls for voter intimidation, the DNCâ€™s legal action could land him in contempt of court â€“ and facing a jail term. 
The RNC is working in active concert with Trump, the Trump campaign, and [Roger] Stone to intimidate and harass minority voters in violation of this Courtâ€™s Consent Decree. The Court should use its inherent contempt powers to remedy those violations , and enforce future compliance with the Consent Decree, with sanctions. 
Upon a finding that the RNC has violated the Consent Decree, this Court should issue an order extending the Consent Decree for another eight years, according to the terms of the Decree. 
Republicans have spent a massive amount of time and money litigating to escape this Consent Decree just seven years ago, and obtained a new concession to limit itâ€™s term from infinite â€“ which they agreed to in the 1980s â€“ down to an eight year term which wouldâ€™ve expired next December. Now that the DNC has taken Trump and the Republican Party back to court, itâ€™s very likely that the terms of the decree will be extended for another eight years through 2025, which will take it through the next two Presidential election cycles. 
Donald Trump has wasted the entire last month complaining about a â€œrigged electionâ€ and encouraging vigilante poll watchers to visit minority neighborhoods. Now, a federal judge will have to step in to keep his campaign from breaking election laws across the country, and the Republican party will pay the price for his ignorance of election law for years to come. 
â€œThe notion of widespread voter fraud in modern American politics is itself a fraud,â€ said the DNC, â€œEvery attempt to verify the presence of voter fraud has proven fruitless.â€
