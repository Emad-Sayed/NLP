On Sunday, President Barack Obama was on the campaign trail stumping for Hillary Clinton in Florida when he started brutally mocking Donald Trump upon learning that his campaign may have taken away his Twitter account in the final days leading up to the election. 
The president couldnâ€™t help himself; he just had to go after the man who he characterized as being too immature to step into his job. 
â€œApparently his campaign has taken away his Twitter,â€ Obama said during a Florida rally for Hillary Clinton , to laughs. 
The president then used humor to make a point to remind everyone of just what was at stake in this election. â€œIn the last two days, they had so little confidence in his self control, they said: â€Weâ€™re just going to take away your Twitter.â€™ Now, if somebody cant handle a Twitter account, they canâ€™t handle the nuclear code,â€ Obama continued. â€œIf somebody starts tweeting at three in the morning because SNL made fun of you, then you canâ€™t handle the nuclear codes.â€ 
On Sunday, the New York Times reported that Trump no longer controls his Twitter account. Instead, the Republican nominee appears to have aides creating â€œTrump safeâ€ messages on his behalf while he focuses his energy on whining and lying at his live rallies. 
During the rally in the battleground state of Florida, Obama labeled Trump as being â€œuniquely unqualifiedâ€ and â€œtemperamentally unfitâ€ to serve as Commander-in-Chief. â€œIâ€™ve been in this office now almost eight years and hereâ€™s what I can tell you,â€ Obama said. â€œWho you are, what you are, does not change when you take office. It just magnifies who you are. It just shines a spotlight on who are you.â€ Every day thereâ€™s another example of how much of a complete joke Trumpâ€™s campaign has been over the past year. But as much as we would love to laugh at this clown, we must first make sure he doesnâ€™t get elected. Or else the jokeâ€™s on us.
