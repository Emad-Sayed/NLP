Ten-Step Program for Adjusting to President-Elect Trump New York Times. Actually not bad. 
Donald Trump Ran on Protecting Social Security But Transition Team Includes Privatizers / Intercept (martha r). Looks like the answer as to whether Trump was getting rolled by the Republican establishment is coming pretty quickly. Remember that Trump doesnâ€™t owe Wall Street anything; this appears to be the result of turning to Republican â€œexpertsâ€. 
Trump Recruiting Among the Lobbyists He Once Denounced New York Times. 
Donald Trump: JPMorganâ€™s Jamie Dimon Being Considered for Treasury Fortune (resilc). Wonder if Trump is running this trial balloon to make Elizabeth Warren see red and make Trumpâ€™s good buddy Carl Ichan look good by comparison. 
Trumpâ€™s Transition Team Works to Form Cabinet Wall Street Journal. Story flogs Hensarling as a possible Treasury Secretary candidate (gah!) along with other scary ideas. But I tend to discount this because Hensarling is a buddy of Pence, and so far, Trumpâ€™s interactions with Pence have featured lots of friction. And Hensarling is plenty useful to Trump right where he is now. Letâ€™s hope this reading proves to be correct. 
U.S. consumer financial agency could be defanged under Trump Reuters 
Trump Ascends to the Cherry Blossom Throne â€“ Tyler Sic Semper Tyrannis (Kfathi). A contrary view to the links above, and todayâ€™s must read. Bear in mind that he exaggerates the role of Soros in US politics (Eastern Europe is a completely different kettle of fish). Too many other squillionaires throwing $ at candidates and think tanks. See his comment about John Bolton in particular (mind you I donâ€™t see how anyone can think Bolton is a good idea), and his warning: â€œInstead, my friends on the Left, worry that he will not only do what he said he would, but heâ€™ll go above and beyond, and the people will love him for it.â€ But this cheery reading discounts the difficulty Trump will have in securing the ability to govern. Saboteurs on what is nominally your side are a tougher obstacle than external opponents. 
Blankfein Says Trump Infrastructure Commitment Good for Growth Bloomberg (resilc) 
Before Taking the White House, Trump Due in Court over Fraud Vanity Fair. A Presidentâ€™s power of pardon is absolute save for impeachment, so Trump could pardon himself. But would he dare? And Iâ€™m not an expert on immigration law, but itâ€™s hard to see how Trump is on shaky legal ground in deporting undocumented aliens. Other countries do it all the time. Try overstaying your visa and watch what happens if you get caught out. 
Trump Shows Every Sign of Carrying Out Sweeping Immigration Crackdown Bloomberg. If Trump moves too fast on deportations, as opposed to policy changes (as in relying on loud noises, including warnings to employers, to induce many undocumented workers to leave of their own accord), Trump could precipitate sustained and serious protests. But the Feds may lack the staffing to increase deportations all that much near term. 
Record Numbers of Undocumented Immigrants Being Detained in U.S. Bloomberg. Resilc: â€œLast I checked a demo has been in control since 2008.â€ 
Trump bucks protocol on press access Associated Press. Lambert: â€œAnd where were they when Clinton didnâ€™t hold a press conference for ~300 days?â€

The Polls Missed Trump. We Asked Pollsters Why. FiveThirtyEight. Resilc: â€œBecause they are a con and mumbo jumbo?â€ Moi: Notice how Silver focuses on how â€œpollstersâ€ missed to exculpate his own failings. As Keynes said: 
A sound banker, alas, is not one who foresees danger and avoids it, but one who, when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional way along with his fellows, so that no one can really blame him.
