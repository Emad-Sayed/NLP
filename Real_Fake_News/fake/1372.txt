Heseltine strangled dog as part of Thatcher cabinet initiation ceremony 01-11-16 LORD Heseltine has admitted strangling his motherâ€™s dog for his initiation into Margaret Thatcherâ€™s cabinet. The 83-year-old peer said that every member of Thatcherâ€™s inner circle was forced to take a life and steal something irreplaceable from close family to prove they were outside bourgeois morality. He continued: â€œItâ€™s an idea I believe she took from Aleister Crowley. I decided to get both my trials over with at once and choked the dog with my bare hands. â€œMy mother never forgave me, of course, but I have to say it worked. From that moment on I had no sentimental respect for life, and human suffering was no longer any impediment to policy. â€œOf course, I was still terribly upset by what she did to Westland. That poor helicopter company. Still brings tears, even now.â€ The revelation follows Sir Geoffrey Howeâ€™s admission that he threw a chimp from a moving train, Lord Tebbitâ€™s boast of thrashing owls with a riding crop in the Cabinet Room, and Nigel Lawsonâ€™s confession that he hypnotised a swan to fly into a brick wall.
