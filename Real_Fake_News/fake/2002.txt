The Rutgers University student who hosted anti-feminist provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos for his first U.S. college event says the student newspaper fired him Monday because of his conservative views. 
Aviv Khavich published his final column for The Daily Targum Sunday night, arguing that immigration enforcement is not â€œanti-immigrant.â€ 
He spoke as an immigrant himself, born in Israel after his Ashkenazi Jewish parents fled Belarus in the wake of the Soviet Unionâ€™s collapse. 
But the trigger for the firing may have been Khavichâ€™s demand that his column include the phrase â€œillegal aliensâ€ to describe those in the country illegally. 
It was the final straw for the Dailyâ€™s editor, who said Khavich repeatedly fought over â€œstylisticâ€ editing changes to his columns over the past several months.

But two of his last three [columns] were about immigration. Khavich opposes accepting Syrian refugees into America as a security threat, and his final column Sunday said flatly: â€œJustice is mass deportation. Justice is respecting my [legal immigrant] family and millions of others like us.â€ 
Khavich told The College Fix in a phone interview that â€œevery instance of â€illegal alienâ€™ I wrote was changed to â€undocumented immigrantâ€™â€ by his editors. â€œBut I considered it a part of my opinion to not useâ€ the latter term, which he finds â€œpolitically correct and also inaccurate.â€ 
When Khavich complained to his editor about the edited draft, she said the â€œillegalâ€ edit came from the top: Editor in Chief Dan Corey wanted the column to follow Associated Press Style. 
The AP Stylebook was revised three years ago to disapprove of using â€œillegalâ€ to describe a person, as opposed to an action, after having affirmed â€œillegal immigrantâ€ just a year earlier . 
But AP Style also frowns upon â€œundocumentedâ€â€“the term used in Khavichâ€™s published columnâ€“because the term is â€œnot precise.â€ Khavich notes that federal law uses the term â€œalien.â€ 
His editor was â€œnot happyâ€ after being confronted, Khavich said, and he was fired the next day.

â€œAt the slightest questioning of their â€unbiased editing,â€™ they jump at the excuse to rid themselves of someone who has been challenging their narrative,â€ he wrote in The Tab. 
â€œI was writing articles that very strongly challenged narratives,â€ he told The Fix. â€œI am sure that it was a termination was based on political bias.â€
