Consultant Jesse Benton of the pro-Trump Great America Super PAC was just caught on camera admitting that he and his associates have been conducting a voter suppression campaign targeting African-Americans and women. 
â€œIn Cleveland, if we can return Hillary to normal turnout levels â€¦ we can turn her to regular turnout levels sheâ€™s gonna lose about 60,000 votes in that area â€“ thatâ€™s dead heat. So we have a voter suppression campaign quite frankly, targeting African-Americans, and sort of suburban moms, just bad stuff about Hillary, just trying to take their taste for her away.â€ 
Benton is the same Trump operative who was convicted of purchasing the vote of an Iowa state Senator and was recently busted attempting to funnel $2 million in illegal donations from a Chinese donor who turned out to be an undercover Telegraph reporter. 
The Donald Trump campaign has been accusing anybody who dares to speak against them â€“ the Clinton campaign, the media, polling organizations â€“ of â€œriggingâ€ the election against them. But time and time again itâ€™s been obvious that the Republican Party has been the one behind the scenes working to disenfranchis e the American voter â€“ especially non-white, male voters . 
Since the Republicans canâ€™t win this game, they have elected to change the rules instead, by passing restrictive voter ID laws that disenfranchise a large number of voters â€“ especially minorities â€“ from exercising their right to vote, closing down polling stations. 
They justify this in an underhanded appeal to â€œprotecting the integrityâ€ of our democracy by waving the imaginary specter of â€œvoter fraudâ€ over the nationâ€™s head. This is an entirely manufactured crisis that does not exist, but has been used to deprive thousands of potential Democratic voters of their rights. The Republican Party is an enemy of American democracy, and we must punish them for it at the ballot box.
