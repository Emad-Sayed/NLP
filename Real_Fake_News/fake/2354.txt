â€œBe ye therefore perfect . . . even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.â€ 
Letâ€™s compare Christ with the perfected Sufi. First, what are Christâ€™s teachings on the attainment of perfection? 
Almost everyone is familiar with Jesusâ€™ teachings in the Sermon on the Mount. We have all heard of the Masterâ€™s injunction to his disciples: â€œLove thine enemyâ€ and â€œTurn the other cheek.â€ These verses from the Gospel of St Matthew are perhaps the most quoted verses in the New Testament: 
â€œYe have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 
But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. 
And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also. 
And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. 
Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. 
Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. 
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you: 
Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 
But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. 
And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also. 
And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. 
Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. 
Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. 
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; 
That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. 
For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? 
And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others ? do not even the publicans so? 
Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. 
(Matt. 5:38-48) 
Here is a sufi story that addresses the very same concept, but in a different manner; that of strength as opposed to what is typically perceived as weakness. Donâ€™t just read the story, reflect on it, extend it out in your mind and see where it takes you. In that search, you will discover issues within yourself that must be addressed. 
There once was a sufi master who was a soldier. 
During a protracted war, he was at one point engaged in fierce, mortal combat. In the thick of furious battle, he finally overcame a vicious, determined foe. Besting the enemy and driving him to ground, the sufi closed in for the kill. 
At the very moment he was about to deliver a fatal thrust of his sword to the neck of his prostrate enemy, his foe cried out in anguish, â€œAh, If only I had your sword for a single moment, how different things would be!â€ 
At once the sufi stopped his attack and surrendered his sword to his fallen enemy. 
The soldier was dumbfounded. 
Taking the sword from the sufi, he said: â€œWhy did you do this? You could have killed me! I was lost, and now you stop and present me with your sword! Why would you do such a stupid thing? â€” for it is now I who will kill you! â€ 
The sufi shrugged. â€œI come from a family that grants any request, no matter how great,â€ he replied cooly. â€œYou asked for my sword. I am honor bound to fulfill your request.â€ 
The fallen soldier rose, and recognizing the sufi as a perfected master, returned his sword to him. Falling at the feet of the man who had just spared his life, he asked to become his disciple. 
From that day forth, he followed the sufi as his master. Like this? Share it now.
