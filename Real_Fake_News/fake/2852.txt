Itâ€™s a topsy-turvy world when law-breakers â€” those who illegally enter and stay in the United States â€” are sacred cows, while those who criticize the law-breakers are ostracized and demonized. 
On June 16, 2015, when Donald Trump announced that heâ€™s entering the crowded race to become the 2016 Republican presidential nominee, he made some remarks about illegal immigration which brought the wrath of the PC Left on his head. Trump said: 
â€œWhen Mexico sends its people, theyâ€™re not sending their best. Theyâ€™re sending people that have lots of problems. Theyâ€™re bringing drugs. Theyâ€™re bringing crime. Theyâ€™re rapists. I will build a great wall â€“ and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me â€“ and Iâ€™ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.â€ 
For saying that, one business after another severed their ties with Trump. Univision and Comcastâ€™s NBCUniversal cancelled plans to broadcast Trumpâ€™s Miss Universe beauty pageant. Mattress giant Serta said it will stop selling Trump-branded products. Department store giant Macyâ€™s also cut its ties with Trump. 
Such righteous indignation! You would think Trump were a heinous mass murderer or a child-molester or serial rapist or bestialist! 
But Macyâ€™s anti-Trump move has backfired. 
TMZ reports, July 13, 2015: 
Macyâ€™s is paying the price for sacking Donald Trump, because weâ€™ve learned thousands of customers are cutting up their Macyâ€™s credit card in protest. 
Sources connected to the department store tell TMZ, Macyâ€™s has received complaints from approximately 30,000 customers since ending its relationship with Trump nearly 2 weeks ago. 
Weâ€™re told the store has been â€œinundated with complaintsâ€ from customers who believe the department store is unfairly punishing Trump for his views on immigration. 
Our sources say thousands of customers have vowed never to shop at Macyâ€™s again and many of them say theyâ€™re cutting up their Macyâ€™s credit card to make a statement. 
Weâ€™re told the complaints have come in various ways, including phone, Facebook and email. A Macyâ€™s spokesperson would only say, â€œOur Facebook page is often times used by our customers to express their feelings or points of view. Many times it does not correlate to any action.â€ Join the boycott against Macyâ€™s!
