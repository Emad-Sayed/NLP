Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton waves as she takes the stage to speak at a fundraiser at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle, Friday, Oct. 14, 2016.
Months of embarrassing leaks released by WikiLeaks and other sources related to Hillary Clintonâ€™s presidential campaign and the Democratic leadership have time and again proven to be true , while allegations of Russia being behind the effort have not been substantiated with any evidence. Still, thatâ€™s the talking point the campaign continues to go with.
And indeed Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri today warned against believing any new things released by WikiLeaks that are embarrassing to the Clinton campaign, even though the other releases were spot on, insisting that anything else they release is â€œ probably fake .â€
Friends, please remember that if you see a whopper of a Wikileaks in next two days â€“ it's probably a fake.

This isnâ€™t a brand new claim, either, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D â€“ CA) making claims as far back as August that any future mass leaks would probably include â€œ Russian lies â€ designed to embarrass Clinton and the Democrats.
These preemptive warnings appear to recognize the reality that more embarrassing information is likely to come out, and aiming to get out in front of the next batch by preemptively declaring them â€œprobablyâ€ not true, whatever it turns out to be.
