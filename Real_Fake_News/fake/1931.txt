Libertarian Party VP insults Trump, practically endorses Clinton Published time: 26 Oct, 2016 21:09 Get short URL Libertarian vice presidential candidate Bill Weld (L) and Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump. © Reuters Calling Trump â€œunhingedâ€ and â€œnot stableâ€ and accusing him of stirring up â€œenvy, resentment, and group hatred,â€ the Libertarian Party VP nominee Bill Weld said he would continue through the election but practically endorsed Clinton without naming her. 
Weld, Gary Johnsonâ€™s running mate, said he would remain on the Libertarian Party ticket through the election but emphasized that â€œTrump should not, cannot, and must not be elected President of the United States.â€ 
â€œA President of the United States operates every day under a great deal of pressure â€” from all sides, and in furtherance of many different agendas. With that pressure comes constant criticism,â€ Weld said in a statement issued Wednesday in Boston. 
â€œAfter careful observation and reflection, I have come to believe that Donald Trump, if elected President of the United States, would not be able to stand up to this pressure and this criticism without becoming unhinged and unable to perform competently the duties of his office.â€ Libertarian VP nominee Bill Weld on MSNBC wishes Clinton a happy birthday, as he discusses issuing his statement against Trump pic.twitter.com/uOrqCpwDyy â€” Eli Watkins (@EliBWatkins) October 26, 2016 
Weld said the Libertarian Party had made strides â€œt oward breaking the two party monopoly,â€ and that America would be stronger when it did, but â€œgiven the Commission on Presidential Debates, the deck is stacked against a credible third party ticket.â€ 
The Libertarian Party, led by former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson, was polling under 10 percent nationally, not enough for the party to be included in the presidential debates. 2+2= #ImWithHer .

A former Republican governor of Massachusetts, Weld said he â€œstepped out of the swirl of the campaignâ€ to alert voters to Trumpâ€™s failings as a potential presidential nominee. He stopped short of endorsing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by name. 
â€œMr. Trump has some charisma and panache, and intellectual quickness. These qualities can be entertaining. Yet more than charisma, more even than intellectual ability, is required of a serious candidate for this countryâ€™s highest office. A serious candidate for the Presidency of the United States must be stable, and Donald Trump is not stable.â€ â€” RT America (@RT_America) September 27, 2016 
Weld said Trump had demonstrated his inability to handle criticism or blame and that his first instinct was to lash out and when challenged â€œhe often responds as a child might.â€ 
â€œHe makes a sour face, he calls people by insulting names, he waves his arms, he impatiently interrupts. Most families would not allow their children to remain at the dinner table if they behaved as Mr. Trump does. He has not exhibited self-control, the discipline, or the emotional depth necessary to function credibly as a President of the United States,â€ Weld said.

Weld said Trump â€œconjured up enemiesâ€ from 11 million immigrants to Americaâ€™s trading partners and that â€œhis ideas of Americaâ€™s enemies includes almost anyone who talks or looks different from him.â€ 
â€œThis is not the time to cast a jocular or feel-good vote for a man whom you may have briefly found entertaining. Donald Trump should not, cannot, and must not be elected President of the United States,â€ the Libertarian VP candidate concluded.
