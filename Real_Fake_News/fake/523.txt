Thursday 3 November 2016 â€œWe won, you lost, get over itâ€ Brexiters told outside High Court 
Brexit supporters have been â€gently encouragedâ€™ to accept the rule of law and allow parliament to vote on whether Article 50 should be triggered. 
The High Court has ruled that Parliament must vote on whether the UK can start the process of leaving the European Union, leaving all Brexit supporters having to get over it. 
Remain campaigner, Simon Williams, told us, â€œThe entire Brexit movement is really big on accepting results, so we have no doubts whatsoever that they will give a knowing nod at this result and simply get over it. 
â€œI shouldnâ€™t imagine thereâ€™ll be a single dissenting voice to be heard anywhere in their ranks, as they tell each other they lost fair and square, and itâ€™s time to move on with their lives. 
â€œAfter all, when you lose, youâ€™ve got to try and get over it. That is the only option available to losers, as they have taught us all so well over the last few months. 
â€œOf course, they might want to try and overthrow the democratic rule of law, but then we might find we get some new portmanteaus like â€crying Brexitearsâ€™ and â€throwing a Brexitantrumâ€™.â€ Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!
