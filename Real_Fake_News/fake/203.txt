BNI Store Nov 5 2016 Muslims regularly use â€œInshallahâ€ (â€œGod Willingâ€ in Arabic) and nobody calls it â€Christophobicâ€™ hate speechâ€¦so why is â€œDeus Vultâ€ (â€œGod Willingâ€ in Latin) graffiti being called â€Islamophobicâ€™ Crusader hate speech? At the newly sharia-compliant University of Southern Maine, moronic school officials say â€œDeus Vultâ€ Graffiti of Crusadesâ€™ rallying cry is being referred to the state Attorney Generalâ€™s office after the Latin phrase used by Christians was written on a desk and wall in a student government office. Press Herald The phrase was used as a rallying cry for Christians during the Crusades in medieval times, and more recently has now is being called an anti-Muslim insult. In an email to the campus community, USM President Glenn Cummings condemned the â€œanti-Muslim graffitiâ€ found in the office in the Woodbury Campus Center. â€œI want you to know that addressing this is our highest priority. Our campus security is fully investigating what we believe to be a hate crime,â€ Cummings wrote. â€œA team from our Dean of Students is working hard to uncover the facts while providing opportunities for intergroup dialogue and supporting students directly and indirectly affected by this reprehensible act. (Itâ€™s free speech, you idiot, and Muslims use the exact same phrase everyday, especially when trying to impose their death cult on non-muslims) British member of ISIS Mostly, to our Muslim students I want to express how sorry I am this has happened. Please know that such actions affect all of us. This is not who USM is or wants to be.â€ (USM is a school of politically correct asswipes who should be fired) According to USMâ€™s student body president (a Muslim, of course) , Muhammad â€œHumzaâ€ Khan, a male student who is not part of student government drew the graffiti Tuesday afternoon, while two student Senate members were in the office. Khan, who declined to identify the student because of the investigation, said the two witnesses have said they didnâ€™t understand the meaning of the phrase â€“ which was written in small letters on an electrical wire cover on a wall, and on a wooden desk. USM officials also have not released the studentâ€™s name. In a Facebook post, USM student body Vice President Matt Raymond condemned the graffiti. â€œI just wanted to say that all this happened a day after five Muslim students asked for applications to Student Government to become Senators. I believe this act of â€œcriminal intimidationâ€ (Seriously? You should be taken away in a straitjacket) to be linked to that fact,â€ Raymond wrote, adding that student government is open to all students of any race, gender, religion, sexuality, economic background or nationality.â€ (It is, but you canâ€™t blame students for hating Muslims, the biggest threat to America) Southwest Airlines knows what it means and acted accordingly Humza Khan, myself, and our Cabinet under the Executive branch condemn in the harshest terms this crime of bias and intimidation. Letâ€™s show folks that USM is a diverse and inclusive university for all moving forward!â€ A group of about 40 students rallied in support of Muslim students at lunchtime Thursday. Raymond said he plans to ask the student Senate to vote out two members who he believes did not respond appropriately to the incident. Khan said he believes the person who wrote the graffiti intended to intimidate Muslim students who have expressed interest in joining the student Senate. â€œThe way Muslims see (that Latin phrase,) we see it indirectly as â€Letâ€™s kill Muslims,â€™ â€ said Khan, who is Muslim. (But Muslim students who keep saying Death to Israel/Death to America are said to be exercising their freedom of speech) â€œItâ€™s not immediately seen as racist, itâ€™s not a racial epithet, but itâ€™s still there to intimidate a specific group of people,â€ Raymond said. â€œAnd it served its purpose, even though it was coded language.â€ (One can only hope. Muslims should be banned from holding office anywhere America. Look at the mess the Muslim in the White House has made)
