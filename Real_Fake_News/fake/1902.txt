C.E. Dyer writes that Bill and Hillary Clinton are generous people â€” that is, generous toward themselves. 
The Clintons are probably the worldâ€™s most famous grifters and the Clinton Farce Foundation has proven to be a great cover for them. 
Bill and Hillary gave $1,042,000 to charity according to their tax return and $1 million of that went to, you guessed it, the Clinton Foundation. Of the $1,042,000 the Clintons gave to charity as listed on their return, $1 million went to the Clinton Foundation https://t.co/IuNXUGZBdC

Itâ€™s a pretty slick move: donate to your own charity and write it off on your taxes. One twitter user aptly called the Clinton Foundation â€œtheir own slush fund.â€ 
As far as the money laundering comment goes, well, dirty money does need to get clean, you know, and Clinton Foundation money is dirty in more ways than one. 
First, itâ€™s a great way to make enough money to pay for Hillaryâ€™s ugly designer clothes and Billâ€™s girlfriends â€” not to mention that Chelsea needs a job; $600,000 at NBC only goes so far, you know. 
Second, the Clinton Foundation takes enormous amounts of money from countries with disgusting human rights abuses and all the Clintons have to do is a photo-op here and there to make it look like itâ€™s all about charity and whatnot. 
This fits perfectly with the Democrat Party, though â€” it doesnâ€™t matter what is, just what it looks like, and fortunately for them Democrat voters arenâ€™t the most discerning bunch. 
Apparently Clinton made $10.6 million in 2015â€¦but hey, sheâ€™s just like us! 
Sheâ€™s your neighbor down the street who canâ€™t climb the stairs, screams at everyone and gets away with massive fraud and has yet to be held accountable for the death of four Americans on her watch â€” not to mention the others that drop like flies around her. 
Then thereâ€™s creepy, pervy, pathological liar uncle Bill, and their neâ€™er-do-well daughter Chelsea with questionable paternity â€” although thatâ€™s probably a lot more common â€¦ 
Everyoneâ€™s got neighbors like that right?
