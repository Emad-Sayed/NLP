England players controversially allowed to wear three lions 02-11-16 FIFA has turned down a request to stop the England team disrespecting the England crest by wearing it. Many fans believe the current teamâ€™s wearing of the three lions shows a lack of respect to those who had gone before them and managed to pass a ball ten yards. England supporter Wayne Hayes said: â€œIs this what Terry Butcher ran around with his head pissing blood for? Is this why Gazza cried? Is this why Geoff Thomas shanked that shot against France? â€œTo see the crest besmirched by Wayne Rooney wearing it while wandering around the pitch like heâ€™s in IKEA is a disgrace.â€ England manager Gareth Southgate said: â€œThe decision whether to wear the three lions should be a personal one, unless you fuck up a vital penalty youâ€™re inexplicably taking in a major tournament, in which case you should be allowed nowhere near them.â€ Funds raised by the sale of England shirts with the crest help to fund various causes, such as firing managers and staging doomed bids to host the world cup.
