Hillary Clintonâ€™s top advisers blame FBI Director James Comey for the Democratâ€™s bruising loss to President-elect Donald Trump. 
Navin Nayak, the head of the Clinton campaignâ€™s opinion research division, sent an email to senior staffers Thursday, outlining â€œearly signalsâ€ as to why the candidate lost the November 8 presidential election, POLITICO reported on Friday. 
â€œWe believe that we lost this election in the last week,â€ said Nayakâ€™s email, which was published by POLITICO. â€œ Comeyâ€™s letter in the last 11 days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among college-educated white voters â€” particularly in the suburbs.â€ 
â€œWe also think Comeyâ€™s 2nd letter, which was intended to absolve Sec. Clinton, actually helped to bolster Trumpâ€™s turnout,â€ he continued. 
The letter also highlighted several other challenges the Clinton team faced throughout the campaign, including a desire for change after two terms by a Democratic president and the reluctance of some Americans to vote for a female candidate.

Despite those challenges, Nayak said, Clinton was on course to win until the last week, when â€œeverything changed" and the momentum began to shift in favor of Trump. 
â€œVoters who decided in the last week broke for Trump by a larger margin (42-47). These numbers were even more exaggerated in the key battleground states,â€ he said. 
The FBI director angered Democrats late in October by announcing in a letter to Congress that the agency had uncovered new emails connected to the Clinton email investigation. 
Just over a week later, Comey notified Congress that Clinton would not face charges over the newly discovered messages. 
Nayak said Comeyâ€™s letters encouraged Trump supporters and depressed the turnout for Clinton on Election Day. 
â€œThere is no question that a week from Election Day, Sec. Clinton was poised for a historic win. In the end, less than 110K votes out of tens of millions cast on Election Day made the difference in this race,â€ he wrote. 
â€œIn the end,â€ Nayak concluded, â€œlate breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome.â€ 
Clinton had been leading Trump throughout the campaign in most of the polls except for the last week of the election when she lost ground to Trump.
