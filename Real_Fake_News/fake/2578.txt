A military commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps has reportedly told the countryâ€™s state controlled media that Iran will soon be sending elite forces into the United States and Europe in an effort to thwart potential plots against the rogue Islamic Republic.
As the Washington Free Beacon has reported, the commander stated that at the direction of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, the IRGC will soon send their elite forces to operate in both the US and Europe under the goal of bolstering Iranâ€™s hardline regime.
â€œThe IRGC is [the] strong guardian of the Islamic Republicâ€¦ The Fedayeen of Velayat [fighting force] are under the order of Iranâ€™s Supreme leader. Defending and protecting the Velayat [the Supreme Leader] has no border and limit.â€ Salar Abnoush, deputy coordinator of Iranâ€™s Khatam-al-Anbia Garrison stated.
Abnoushâ€™s provocative comments come at a time where Iran is actively upgrading their military hardware and attempting to strengthen their presence throughout the Middle East with funds provided by the Obama Administration.

â€œThe whole world should know that the IRGC will be in the U.S. and Europe very soon,â€ Salar Abnoush, deputy coordinator of Iranâ€™s Khatam-al-Anbia Garrison, an IRGC command front, was quoted as saying in an Iranian state-controlled publication closely tied to the IRGC.
Iranian military and government officials have continued to advocate violence against the U.S. and its allies, despite the nuclear deal and several secret side agreements that gave Iran $1.7 billion in cash.
Iran accuses the U.S. of violating its end of the agreement by not helping the Islamic Republic gain further access to international banks and other markets.
â€œOur enemies have several projects to destroy our Islamic revolution, and have waged three wars against us to execute their plans against our Islamic Republic,â€ Abnoush said. â€œThe IRGC has defeated enemies in several fronts. The enemy surrendered and accepted to negotiate with us.â€
â€œAnd now all of our problems are being solved and our country is becoming stronger in all fronts. Some believe the holy defense ended,â€ the military leader added. â€œThey are wrong; the holy defense continues, and today, it is more complicated than before.â€
Another source who advises congressional leaders on Iran sanctions issues told the Free Beacon that the Obama administration is blocking Congress from taking action to stop this type of infiltration by Iranian forces.
â€œIran is ideologically, politically, and militarily committed to exporting the Islamic revolution through terrorism, which is why even the Obama administration says theyâ€™re the worldâ€™s foremost state sponsor of terrorism,â€ the source said. â€œCongress wants to act, but Obama officials keep saying that new laws are unnecessary because the U.S. has enough tools to block Iranian terror expansion. Instead of using those tools, though, theyâ€™re sending Iran billions of dollars in cash while Iran plants terror cells in Europe and here at home.â€
