[10/31/16] Monday on his radio show, while discussing the FBI reopening the investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, conservative host Glenn Beck said FBI director James Comey contacting Congress is â€œone of the most irresponsible things to ever happen.â€ 
Beck said, â€œFor him to go for the subpoena and announce it and open this thing up when he says he doesnâ€™t know if thereâ€™s even anything in those emails, thatâ€™s not too big of a risk for him, that is too big of a risk of anyoneâ€™s career, and not his, hers.â€ Post navigation
