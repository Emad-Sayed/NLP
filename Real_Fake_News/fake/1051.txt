The victory of Republican Party candidate Donald Trump in the US presidential elections proves that Washingtonâ€™s political class and the mainstream US media are completely detached from the actual US electorate, Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity Executive Director Daniel McAdams told Sputnik.
â€œMore than anything else, Donald Trumpâ€™s victory has proven the entire political class in Washington and especially the mainstream media that does their bidding to be completely out of touch with the American people,â€ McAdams said.
According to McAdams, over the course of the election, the mainstream media has proven not to be independent resources seeking out inconvenient truths, but rather â€œa lapdog to the power elite.â€
Earlier in the day, Trump won the US presidential elections despite most of the analysts and opinion polls predicting his defeat to Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton.
