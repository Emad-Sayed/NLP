Former United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova suggested Friday James Comeyâ€™s reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails was the product of a â€œrevoltâ€ inside the FBI. 
While speaking with WMALâ€™s Larry Oâ€™Connor , diGenova was asked what Comey meant by saying newly discovered Clinton emails from Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedinâ€™s devices â€œappear to be pertinentâ€ to the FBIâ€™s prior investigation. 
â€œIt tells me that the original investigation was not thorough, and that it was an incompetent investigation,â€ diGenova said, â€œotherwise they would have discovered this â€” and Iâ€™ll tell you why.â€ 
â€œThese were found on the phone that was used by Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin,â€ he said. â€œWhy was that phone not looked at originally?â€ 
â€œThere could be one explanation: Huma Abedin may have denied that any other phone existed, and if she did, she committed a felony. She lied to the FBI just like General Cartwright, and if she did, sheâ€™s dead meat, and Comey knows it, and thereâ€™s nothing he can do about it.â€ 
diGenova continued: â€œAnd why this letter was sent today was very simple: the agents came to Comey yesterday, they told him about the evidence, and he said oh â€Sâ€™, and realized that his goose was cooked, that this would prove conclusively that his original investigation was incompetent, and he knew that the agents running the Weiner case would leak it if he did not send this letter to congress.â€ 
â€œAnd Iâ€™ve also been told something very significant, itâ€™s been reported that those laptops [belonging to Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson] were destroyed, they were not, and the reason is the FBI agents refused to do it.â€ 
diGenova went on to say he believes â€œthere is a quiet but serious revolt against the director right now.â€ 
â€œHe sent those letters today because he is in deep trouble inside the bureau,â€ he said. â€œComey sent this letter today because he had to. He has no moral authority inside the agency right now, heâ€™s a joke, heâ€™s a laughingstock of the agency, and among former FBI agents, he has become an anathema.â€
