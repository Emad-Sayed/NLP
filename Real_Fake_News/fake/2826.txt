For like the eleventy-billionth time, Sarah Palin posted a broken link to a Facebook post on Twitter Sunday. Now, at first glance her months of posting dead links and not figuring out how to fix the problem might seem moderately stupid â€” until you see the content of the actual post on the half-term, half-wit former Governor of Alaskaâ€™s Facebook timeline. 
Referencing Clintonâ€™s recent, mundane campaign stop at a bar, Palin â€” who regularly appears to be heavily intoxicated whenever she has a camera in front of her and was involved in a drunken hillbilly brawl in 2014 â€” quipped, â€œsheâ€™s gonna drive us all to drink.â€ 
Thinking she is clever, she then adds that Clinton should have been â€œthinking Sam Adamsâ€ rather than â€œdrinking Sam Adams.â€ 
Naturally, as Palin brought up drinking, the internet decided it couldnâ€™t let this one go: @SarahPalinUSA I see you've already started
