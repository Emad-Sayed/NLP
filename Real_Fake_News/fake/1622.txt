Gay man finds it in himself to tolerate religious person 01-11-16 A GAY man has met a Christian who appears civilised and could even be described as nice. Tom Booker met church-goer Wayne Hayes when he started working in his office, and has expressed his surprise that he â€really couldnâ€™t tellâ€™. Booker said: â€œWe often end up in the kitchen at the same time to make a cup of tea, so we started exchanging pleasantries and worked up to longer conversations. â€œHe was always nice enough and talked about his family and allotment and stuff, so I presumed he was just a normal person. However, a few weeks later he mentioned something about believing in God. â€œI was really shocked, but he seemed very cool about it. I asked if he thought it was just a phase and he said no, heâ€™d been feeling this way since he was about nine. â€œI wanted to ask him what Christians actually do in church, but I got worried that he might think Iâ€™m secretly into it and try to recruit me. He hasnâ€™t mentioned it since. â€œItâ€™s almost as if itâ€™s a perfectly acceptable way to live your life, which has really given me pause for thought. â€œJust because you expect someone to be a massively judgemental dickhead, it doesnâ€™t mean they will be.â€
