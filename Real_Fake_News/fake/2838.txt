Republican nominee Donald Trump is an admitted serial sexual predator. His own recorded words confirm as much, as do the dozen or so women who have come forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct. His campaign is desperately fighting to put a lid on the growing awareness that Trump will be testifying under oath during a trial in federal court under the accusation of raping a thirteen-year-old girl and a previously undisclosed second girl, who was even younger . 
The case was thrown out in May due to a clerical error, but re-filed in June with two new witnesses â€“â€œJoan Doeâ€ and â€œTiffany Doeâ€ who both say they worked as â€œparty plannersâ€ for convicted child rapist and billionaire Jeffery Epstein. Part of that â€œplanningâ€ appears to have been procuring girls for the party, as â€œJoan Doeâ€ revealed in her deposition that she convinced victim â€œJane Doeâ€ to attend four different parties with promises of money and â€œmeeting contactsâ€ in the modelling industry â€“ a story that matches the account of another person who would arrange for underage women to attend Trumpâ€™s parties. 
At one of these parties, â€œJane Doeâ€ was forced to perform oral sex on Trump with a twelve-year old named â€œMaria.â€ At the fourth and final encounter, Tiffany Doe says â€œ I personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldnâ€™t ever say anything if she didnâ€™t want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed.â€ 
â€œMariaâ€ hadnâ€™t been seen since the previous encounter. Trump then forcibly raped â€œJane Doe,â€ who was then raped and sodomized again by Jeffery Epstein, who was apparently furious tha t Trump had ta ken her virginity and not him, beating her in his fury . 
Donald Trump told New York magazine in 2002 that â€œIâ€™ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. Heâ€™s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it â€” Jeffrey enjoys his social life.â€ 
Epsteinâ€™s brother, Mark, also testified that â€œTrump flew on Jeffreyâ€™s private jet at least once and records indicate that Trump called Epstein twice in November of 2004.â€ 
Epstein eventually recieved a slap on the wrist â€“ 13 months in prison and registration as a sex offender â€“ for decades of abuse : 
â€œaccording to law-enforcement officials and alleged victims, between the years 1998 and 2007â€”and possibly even earlierâ€”he ran a particularly vile pyramid scheme that involved paying minors around $200 at a time to perform sexual massages nearly every day and then recruit even younger girls to do the same. (â€œThe more you do, the more you are paid,â€ one said.) During these massages, girls as young as 13 told police they were instructed to get undressed. Epstein would masturbate or penetrate them, they saidâ€”with his finger, or a vibrator, or his allegedly egg-shaped penis.â€ 
The details keep coming, and the picture they paint grows darker and more horrifying by they day. How much more evidence does America need? How many more stories need to be told before the word of one rich man is outweighed by literally dozens of contrasting accounts? Donald Trump is a sexual predator and a possible pedophile; he deserves a jail cell on Rikerâ€™s Island, not the White House.
