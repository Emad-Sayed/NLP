BNI Store Nov 2 2016 â€œWe are losing control of the streets,â€ say police as Angela Merkelâ€™s Germany descends into chaos and lawlessness GERMAN Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing catastrophe over her failed mass Muslim migration policy, according to a new report. Germany has been hit by a tidal wave of horrendous violent crime including rapes, sexual and physical assaults, stabbings, home invasions, robberies, burglaries and drug traffickingâ€¦not to mention Islamic terrorist attacks. UK Express Adding to the countryâ€™s woes is the fact that thousands of people have gone missing after travelling there on invitation from Anegla Merkel. Germany took in more than 1.1million migrants in the past year and parts of the country are crippled with a lack of infrastructure. Now the true reality is hitting home ahead of next yearâ€™s elections as the far right surges in the polls threatening to topple the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Mrs Merkel. According to a report by the international policy council the Gatestone Institute, local police in many parts of the country admit that they are stretched to the limit. Despite the mayhem caused by skyrocketing violent crime and terror attacks by Muslim migrants, German officials insist on blaming the unrest on the rise of the â€œfar right extremistsâ€ (aka German patriots). The report states: â€œThe rape of a ten-year-old girl in Leipzig, the largest city in Saxony, has drawn renewed attention to the spiralling levels of violent crime perpetrated by migrants in cities and towns across Germany. â€œThousands of migrants who entered the country as â€asylum seekersâ€™ or â€refugeesâ€™ have gone missing. They are, presumably, economic migrants who entered Germany on false pretences. â€œMany are thought to be engaging in robbery and criminal violence.â€ According to Freddi Lohse of the German Police Union in Hamburg, many migrant offenders view the leniency of the German justice system as a green light to continue delinquent behaviour, says the report. He said: â€œThey are used to tougher consequences in their home countries. â€œThey have no respect for us.â€ After the â€œrefugeeâ€ disaster that Angela Merkel has created, she is now unsettled about Europe returning to nationalism. Nationalism is a nightmare for all the liberal leaders working for a New World Order. â€œDuring the first six months of 2016, Muslim migrants committed 142,500 crimes , according to the Federal Criminal Police Office. This is equivalent to 780 crimes committed by migrants every day, an increase of nearly 40 per cent over 2015. The data includes only those crimes in which a suspect has been caught. Muslim migrants committed 208,344 crimes in 2015 , according to a confidential police report leaked to Bild. This figure represents an 80 per cent increase since 2014 and is equivalent to 570 crimes committed by migrants every day, or 23 crimes each hour, in 2015 alone. â€œNearly 70 per cent of respondents said they fear for their lives and property in German train stations and subways, while 63 per cent feel unsafe at large public events.â€ The report added: â€œThe growing sense of lawlessness is substantiated by an October 24 YouGov poll which found that 68 per cent of Germans believe that security in the country has deteriorated during the past several years. Germans are taking to the streets in the thousands in weekly protests against the Muslim invasion started by the Obama/Soros/Clinton Arab Spring and aided and abetted by Angela Merkel. Meanwhile a female police officer has admitted that officers are under attack and that the courts are a â€œjoke.â€ In a new book, Tania Kambouri, a German police officer, said: â€œFor weeks, months and years I have noticed that Muslims, mostly young men, do not have even a minimum level of respect for the police. â€œWhen we are out patrolling the streets, we are verbally abused by young Muslims. â€œThere is the body language, and insults like â€s*** copâ€™ when passing by. â€œIf we make a traffic stop, the aggression increases ever further, this is overwhelmingly the case with migrants. â€œIt cannot be that offenders continue to fill the police files, hurt us physically, insult us, whatever, and there are no consequences. â€œMany cases are closed or offenders are released on probation or whatever. â€œYes, what is happening in the courts today is a joke.â€ The construction of a small mosque, the first in the German state of Thuringia, created controversy after the Alternative for Germany party labeled it a â€land grab projectâ€™ and announced a massive anti-Islam rally.
