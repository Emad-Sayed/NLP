Friend from university is an arse now 31-10-16 A MAN who bumped into an old university friend has discovered that he is now a total dickhead. Julian Cook lost contact with former housemate Martin Bishop for over eight years ago, during which time Bishop has become a money-obsessed macho twat who thinks he is the bollocks. Office worker Cook said: â€œInstead of talking about old times he kept asking me what sort of car I have. â€œThen he blathered on about â€taking home serious Ksâ€™ from â€folio development resalesâ€™, assuming I knew what that meant because otherwise I would not be a proper man. â€œThe worst bit was when he told me about some fringe political group heâ€™s into called Libertarian England. No, actually it was when he said â€pussy alertâ€™ when a woman walked past. â€œHe probably just works and socialises with dipshits, but I wouldnâ€™t rule out one of those injuries that turns you into a psychopath. Maybe he fell off a raft at a team-building weekend and hit his head on the riverbed. â€œWe parted on friendly terms but now he wants me to join his â€weights oriented gymâ€™ and go to a lapdancing club, which is odd because he used to be into Star Trek Generations .â€
