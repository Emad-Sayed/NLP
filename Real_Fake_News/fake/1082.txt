Transcript via Fox News Sunday: WALLACE: The last question I want to ask you is that youâ€™re acting as if it was the director who brought this into the election when the fact is that it was Hillary Clinton who brought this into the election. 
I want to go back to the e-mail exchange on March 2nd, 2015, when The New York Times broke the story about Hillary Clinton using private e-mails. Weâ€™re going to put it up on the screen. 
Clinton adviser Neera Tanden, â€œWhy didnâ€™t they get the stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy.â€ 
Campaign chairman John Podesta, â€œUnbelievable.â€ Tanden, â€œI guess I know the answer, they wanted to get away with it.â€ 
Robby, it was Clinton who delayed and it was Clinton who brought this into the presidential campaign. 
MOOK: And it is Secretary Clinton who has said this was a mistake. It is Secretary Clinton who cooperated fully with the investigation. And it was Secretary Clinton who accepted the outcome of that investigation. And what secretary Clinton is doing now is saying, if thereâ€™s new information, get it out on the table. Letâ€™s get it out. These could be duplicates. 
Again, itâ€™s been reported these e-mails may not have been sent or received by Secretary Clinton. We donâ€™t know anything. And this close to an election, this unprecedented announcement of new information, when â€“ when, again, itâ€™s been reported by Yahoo! News that â€“ that the FBI may have not even seen it. That â€“ that â€“ that Director Comey sent this unprecedented letter shortly before the election when he doesnâ€™t even know what the information is. Thatâ€™s disturbing. And weâ€™re just asking him, get everything out there that he knows. 
Fox News has no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Clinton, so they have been reduced to whining about why she didnâ€™t release the emails sooner. What Wallace left out was that the release of Clintonâ€™s emails represented an unprecedented level of disclosure. 
Hillary Clinton didnâ€™t cause this email scandal. House Republicans misused their Benghazi Select Committee to go on a fishing expedition for Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails. 
Robbie Mook destroyed Fox News with facts, because unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton hasnâ€™t worked to keep information hidden from the public. Trump has not released his tax returns, medical records, or an accounting of his business dealings with Russia. Trump has been the least transparent nominee in more than 40 years. 
Republicans and conservative media are blaming Clinton for the scandal that they created as justification for continuing the investigations of her after the election. 
Clintonâ€™s campaign manager was able to wipe the floor with the Republican talking points because at the end of the day the email scandal remains a conspiracy about nothing.
