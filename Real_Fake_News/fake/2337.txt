Set Staff Horrified At What Hillary Is Caught Doing After Brutal Interview Posted on October 27, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Set of the Commander-in-Chief Forum (left), Hillary Clinton at the Forum (right) 
It was only a matter of time before the glue that keeps Hillary Clinton together cracked and her true evil self came out from behind her forced smile. Looking visibly uncomfortable in front of the camera during a particularly brutal interview, Hillary exited stage left as quick as she could when a horrified staff member caught what she did backstage. 
Hillary probably felt safe going into the interview by liberal-leaning Matt Lauer, who conducted a televised question and answer session with the Democratic candidate in September at the Commander-in-Chief Forum. As sheâ€™s apparently accustomed to, Hillary allegedly received a list of questions before the event, so she could prepare her answers (lies) and prevent being caught on the spot to come up with what to say, making her come across flawlessly to the public. Thinking everything was worked to her advantage as is typically the case, Lauer threw the candidate a curve ball that Hillary couldnâ€™t hide from. 
According to The Watch Towers, a Comcast official (the parent company of NBC Universal) stated that Lauer went rogue when he asked â€œone legitimate question about the FBI investigation concerning her homemade server and the unsecured emails.â€ The alleged informant said at that point â€œwe could see she (Hillary) was beginning to boil.â€ 
Itâ€™s evident by her expression and tone caught in the recording of the Forum interview that Hillary wasnâ€™t happy about being forced to answer a question she wasnâ€™t prepared for. Holding her rage inside the best she could, the person claiming to be a producer on the set, accused Hillary of launching an explosive verbal assault on her staff backstage after the interview. 
â€œShe was in a full meltdown and no one on her staff dared speak with her â€“ she went kind of manic and didnâ€™t have any control over herself at that point,â€ the anonymous informant claimed in an unconfirmed report by Watch Towers . 
â€œHillary proceeded to pick up a full glass of water and throw it at the face of her assistant, and the screaming started,â€ the description of the alleged events also said. The staffer claimed that they heard Hillary turn her rage on Donald Trump, saying, â€œIf that f â€“ â€“ â€“ ing bastard wins, we all hang from nooses! Lauerâ€™s finishedâ€¦and if I lose itâ€™s all on your heads for screwing this up.â€ 
While the reports of this incident have not been authenticated, it definitely doesnâ€™t seem out of character for Hillary, and with what happened to Lauer after the interview certainly shows that the Democratic candidate complained. â€œMatt Lauer was massively criticized for the rest of the week on air by the Clinton campaign and the rest of the MSM as having conducted â€an unfair and partisan attack on Clintonâ€™,â€ Watch Towers reported. 
As we saw in the court hearings over Benghazi, Hillary is a loose cannon when being called out on her illegal, dishonest, and deadly actions that sheâ€™s not used to being confronted on. Whether this explosive tirade happened or not â€” to any degree of severity â€” her angry actions against the American people and our heroes she disrespects, speak volumes about who she is, which isnâ€™t someone we need leading our country.
