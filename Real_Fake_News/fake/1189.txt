Radio Tuesday 8 November 2016 by Spacey If you think our media is racist, wait till you meet my grandfather, Prince Harry tells Meghan Markle 
After calling out media â€racismâ€™ over coverage of his girlfriend, Prince Harry has warned Meghan Markle to brace herself for a meeting with Prince Philip. 
The prince released a statement in which he said reporting of his relationship with the American actress had â€crossed a lineâ€™ that was similar to suggesting youâ€™ll get slitty eyes if you spend too long in China.

Prince Philip has revealed that he is looking forward to meeting his grandsonâ€™s new girlfriend.
