Russia unveiled a weapon capable of reaching United States territory recently, and on its heels, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the actions undertaken in Washington are â€œpushing Russia into a nuclear arms race,â€ according to Zero Hedge . 
Zero Hedge reported: 
Yesterday, Russia reveals photos of a new highly advanced liquid fuelled heavy ICBM capable of evading anti-missile defences and hitting US territory with 10 tonne nuclear payload. 
The Makeyev Design Bureau â€“ the designer of Russiaâ€™s heavy liquid fuelled Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (â€œICBMsâ€) â€“ ie. of missiles capable of reaching US territory from Russian territory, has published the first picture of Russiaâ€™s new heavy Sarmat ICBM which is due to enter service shortly, probably in 2018. 
The Makeyev Design Bureau also released this statement along with the picture of the Sarmat ICBM: â€œIn accordance with the Decree of the Russian Government â€On the State Defence Order for 2010 and the planning period 2012-2013,â€™ the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau was instructed to start design and development work on the Sarmat. In June 2011, the Bureau and the Russian Ministry of Defense signed a state contract for the Sarmatâ€™s development. The prospective strategic missile system is being developed in order to assuredly and effectively fulfil objectives of nuclear deterrent by Russiaâ€™s strategic forces.â€ 
As Zero Hedge noted, the Sarmat has a specific goal of evading U.S. anti-ballistic missile systems that have been deployed in Eastern Europe. 
This is yet another reason why we need a president who understands the importance of modernizing and beefing up our military in these uncertain times. 
While the U.S. stays stuck in the 1960â€™s and 1970â€™s with our strategic deterrents, Russia is working to upgrade their armory. The new Sarmat missile is set to be ready to go in 2018. 
AntiWarâ€™s Jason Ditz had this to say about the situation between the U.S. and Russia in regard to our respective military capabilities: 
Of course, the United States spends many, many times what Russia does on its military, but the fact that Russia has a proper military capable of defending the nation at all puts it in a total different category from most of Americaâ€™s recent wars, and Russiaâ€™s massive nuclear arsenal makes it clear this is one war which, if the US launches it, they wonâ€™t be able to win outright. 
Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has called for a no-fly zone over Syria. Hereâ€™s what Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, had to say about that. 
â€œRight now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly Iâ€™m not going to make.â€ 
Clintonâ€™s track record â€” both in action and in words â€” proves that she does not have the judgment necessary to be president.
