Bill Clinton will probably have to avoid Hillary even more than usual after his latest showing on the campaign trail, in which it became clear that it isnâ€™t just his wife that has memory issues. 
Slick Willy was out on the campaign trail on Tuesday, angling to get his lecherous, alleged-rapist butt back in the White House, and apparently he forgot his own criminal business partner wifeâ€™s campaign slogan. 
â€œBut we were growing together,â€ Bill said. â€œThis slampaign slogan of Hillaryâ€™s, â€growing together,â€™ itâ€™s more than just two words that sound good.â€ 
Thatâ€™s not a typo either; according to IJR , Bill called Hillaryâ€™s â€œcampaign sloganâ€ a â€œslampaign slogan,â€ before mangling Hillaryâ€™s already-stupid actual campaign slogan: â€œStronger Together.â€ 
Bill probably shouldnâ€™t use â€œIâ€™m With Herâ€ either, since he might lapse into, â€œand her, and her over there, and her right there too.â€ 
â€œStronger Togetherâ€ is also the name of Hillaryâ€™s flop of a book, which I highly doubt Bill bothered to read, although you canâ€™t really blame him for that; he has a hard enough time staying awake when his wife speaks â€” he must be immune to shrill cackling by now. 
Iâ€™m guessing Bill is going to want to stay as far away as he can from Hillary while she likely has one of her infamous â€œcooling offâ€ periods. Hillary has been widely reported to have a nasty temper , so itâ€™d certainly be wise for Bill to stay far away. 
Hillary canâ€™t be mad for too long though, because itâ€™s likely that sheâ€™s going to need Bill to run the White House. Although neither of them appear to be in the greatest health, they can do a great deal of damage between the two of them. 
Bill and Hillary have had a painfully obvious agreement throughout their â€œmarried lifeâ€ to help each other politically. Now itâ€™s Hillaryâ€™s turn and sheâ€™s surely not going to take too kindly to Bill screwing up her ascendancy. 
No need to worry Hillary, youâ€™re responsible for the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, ruining the life of a 12-year-old rape victim, and numerous other crimes and disgusting deeds, so a few memory lapses from Bill wonâ€™t affect the election. 
Hillary managed to forget answers nearly 40 times during the FBI investigation into her use of private servers to send and receive classified information as secretary of state, so forgetting a dumb campaign slogan should be no big whoop. 
What would be nice is if Billâ€™s memory lapses led to a moment of clarity and human decency and he let everyone know where the bodies have been buried during the Clinton mafiaâ€™s assault on American politics. Wonâ€™t happen though; we canâ€™t have nice thingsâ€¦
