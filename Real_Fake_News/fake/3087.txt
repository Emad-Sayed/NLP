Dispatches from STEPHEN LENDMAN A previous article explained the so-called battle for Mosul is a hoax. Itâ€™s about shifting thousands of US-supported ISIS fighters to Syria, along with perhaps letting Turkish forces move in to control evacuated areas. In Moscow, Russian and Syrian foreign ministers expressed concern. Sergey Lavrov said Moscow will â€œtake measures to prevent terrorists moving from Mosul to Syria with their heavy arms, which, of course, will seriously worsen the situation in the Syrian republic.â€ .. â€œWe think that it is important not to let this happenâ€¦We cannot let the terrorist leave Mosul (for) Syria with the aim to re-direct their activity.â€ .. Syrian Foreign Walid al-Muallem said the US-led â€œcoalition has never fought Daesh. On the contrary, it is destroying the infrastructure of the Syrian economy, and recently destroyed a huge number of bridges on the Euphrates Riverâ€¦They want to move Daesh from Mosul into Raqqa.â€ .. Assad close political and media advisor Bouthaina Shaaban explained Washingtonâ€™s dirty scheme, ignored by media scoundrels, saying redeploying ISIS fighters from Mosul to Syria would represent a â€œhuge danger to our sovereignty, to our country.â€ .. â€œRussia and Syria are looking at this issue extremely seriously. Weâ€™re not going to sit and watchâ€¦The way they encircle Mosul shows they would like these terrorists to move into to Syriaâ€¦Theyâ€™re navigating terrorism from one place to another, limiting terrorism in one place, directing it to another place. Thatâ€™s the absolute truth of what is happening in our region.â€ .. Washington and its rogue allies pay lip service alone to fighting terrorism while actively supporting it. So-called â€œmoderatesâ€ arenâ€™t so â€œmoderate,â€ Shaaban explained. â€œThere are no â€™Syrian moderates.â€™ â€œ .. Theyâ€™re cold-blooded cutthroat killers, imperial death squads, serving US imperial interests, actively supported by its coalition partners wanting Assad toppled, Syrian sovereignty destroyed, an Israeli rival eliminated, and Iran isolated ahead of repeating the same scenario against its government. .. Aided by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah fighters, Syria is engaged in the â€œmost challenging issue for humanity in the 21st century,â€ Shaaban stressed â€“ the struggle to defeat the scourge of US created and supported terrorism, threatening everyone everywhere unless challenged and eliminated. .. America intends stopping at nothing to advance its imperium â€“ its goal, unchallenged dominion over planet earth, its resources and populations â€“ a world unfit and unsafe to live in. Beginning with the Bill and Hillary Clinton co-presidencyâ€™s Balkan wars, culminating with the 1999 rape of Yugoslavia, all sovereign independent states have been targeted for regime change â€“ the 9/11 false flag used as pretext to wage phony war on terrorism. .. 
Syria is in the eye of the storm. Conflicts continue raging in all countries America attacked after that staged incident â€“ effectively declaring war on humanity. Will nuclear war on Russia, China and Iran follow Hillaryâ€™s likely ascension to power next year? Her rage for wanting their sovereign governments eliminated risks ending life on earth.
