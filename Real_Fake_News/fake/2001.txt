By: The Voice of Reason | We are less than two weeks away from the moment of truth, when the results of the 2016 Presidential election will more than likely be tallied, and weâ€™ll have a new President-elect, at least in name anyway, if nothing else. Iâ€™ll preface this post by saying itâ€™s not too late for people to still take as many precautions as possible in hopes of ensuring their families safety not if, but when all hell breaks lose upon the announcement of the electionâ€™s winner. The media has done their best to conceal it for whatever reason, but there have been ample warnings that there is the potential for massive amounts of violence regardless of who wins. The second video below runs through a laundry list of crimes committed by Hillary Clinton, which has a lot to do with why four in 10 Trump supporters say they wonâ€™t recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldnâ€™t have won fair and square. The second video cites specifics, and when you hear them, itâ€™s no wonder why former Congressman Joe Walsh called for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, â€œOn November 8th, Iâ€™m voting for Trump . On November 9th, if Trump loses, Iâ€™m grabbing my musket. You in?â€ The former Congressman is hardly alone. A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; and one in five are likely voters are â€œVERY concerned,â€ and they should be. One 69-year old gentleman from Michigan said as the polls began shifting towards Hillary, he slowly began buying more ammunition. If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clintonâ€™s political enemies. Recall that over 70 of them are dead, five of which died in just six weeks under mysterious circumstances during the primaries that Hillary stole from Bernie Sanders. In the first video below, I review warnings issued by both sides of what will happen if the other partyâ€™s candidate wins. So far, if Hillary wins we have one former Congressman going for his gun, and if Trump wins, we have Black Lives Matter members saying saying back in March: â€œDear white people if Trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go. Just so you know.â€ Thatâ€™s just the tip of the icebergâ€¦ The question posed, â€œWhat would you do,â€ is primarily directed at Trump supporters if Hillary wins, because the only way sheâ€™s winning anything, is by fraudulently stealing it, and doing so with Obamaâ€™s help! How can we make that assertion without any doubt? Starting off light, we know not just from Project Veritas videos released this week , but also from Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, that an activist was caught on camera bragging about having helped start violent disruptions at Donald Trump campaign rallies, and brags that was paid by the Clinton campaign directly right before she stirred up trouble. The Project Veritas videos this week merely confirmed the initial account. We also know that despite Julian Assange saying he did not get information from the Russians, when Trump was beginning to pull away from Hillary in the polls, and Hillary needed a distraction, her and Barack Obama had no problem peddling a baseless accusation against Russia, eventually angering Putin to the point where Russia deployed nuclear missiles into Kaliningrad , along the border with Poland, and aimed them directly at our allies in Berlin. Nukes pointed at our allies? Who cares right? In her mind, â€œthe ends justify the means.â€ so long as Hillary winsâ€¦ Then of course, letâ€™s not forget the email that was leaked by Wikileaks that proved that Hillary was not only aware of the transaction, but she allowed weapons to be sold to ISIS during a time of war , weapons that were presumably used against either U.S. troops or American allies at the very least. That act has a name: Treason, and itâ€™s punishable by death. Still, the list goes on, including her use of psychological weapons against voters as detailed in one of her internal campaign documents leaked as part of the Podesta emails. In the second video, Alex Jones makes his point very clearly, that there is NO level the Democrats wonâ€™t stoop to for control of the White House. None. Zero. Furthermore, If by some chance all their fraud isnâ€™t enough, and Hillary doesnâ€™t win, they plan to burn American cities to the ground. Have you heard of any plans put in place by Obama to stop that? Of course not. Trump supporters: If Hillary is willing to do all those things, and so many more I donâ€™t have the time to go into but have all been well documented, just so she can gain entry into Oval Office, what do you think sheâ€™ll act like once she takes possession of the Office of the President? We know what the Soros funded far-left has planned if Trump wins because theyâ€™ve told us countless times, what about the Trump supporters if Hillary wins? In the video below, Alex Jones asks the question, â€œIs there anything, anything at all that Hillary and the Democrats wonâ€™t do?â€ The answer to that seems clear. The question then is really whether people think that if Hillary is announced as the winner, is it likely that the American voters will put up with that criminal behavior and just roll over, or is it more likely weâ€™re going to see some violence break out?
