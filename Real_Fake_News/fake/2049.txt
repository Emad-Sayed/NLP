LISTEN: Clinton â€Crime Familyâ€™ EXPOSED By Veteran FBI Assistant Director Posted on October 30, 2016 by Shae Weatherall in Politics Share This 
On the heels of the FBI announcing its renewed investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails, Veteran FBI Assistant Director and wiretap expert James Kallstrom is speaking out. In his statements, Kallstrom exposes the Clintons as being a â€œcrime family,â€ adding credence to the long list of allegations against them for unethical and illegal activities throughout the last several decades.

During an interview with radio host John Catsimatidis, former FBI Assistant Director in Charge, New York Division, James Kallstrom, came forward with some serious statements about the Clinton family. According to Kallstrom, the FBIâ€™s original investigation into Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails was impeded by the Department of Justice and other top officials in our government. However, now that the case has been reopened, he is apparently seeing it as an opportunity to add his expert opinion and his own insider knowledge of the situation. 
The Hill has provided a partial transcript of Kallstromâ€™s remarks: 
â€œ The Clintons, thatâ€™s a crime family, basically ,â€ Kallstrom said. â€œ Itâ€™s like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool .â€ 
â€œ The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation ,â€ he said. â€œ Thatâ€™s the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, Iâ€™m sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that .â€ 
â€œ The agents are furious with whatâ€™s going on, I know that for a fact ,â€ he said. 
Listen as former FBI Asst. Director Kallstrom speaks about why he supports Donald Trump as president and explains how he knows that Hillary Clinton would be a devastating choice to lead America. 
Among the many statements he made during the full ten-minute interview , perhaps this one was the most profound: 
â€œ Itâ€™s just outrageous how Hillary Clinton sold her office for money. And sheâ€™s a pathological liar, and sheâ€™s always been a liar. And God forbid if we put someone like that in the White House. â€ 
Given her extensive and tainted legal and political history, it is truly outrageous that Hillary Clinton was ever allowed to become the Democrat nominee for president to begin with. Now, sheâ€™s under a second federal investigation for wrongdoing while she was serving as our Secretary of State, and shockingly, there are still those who support her. 
She is obviously corrupt to the core, but hopefully, over the next few days, as more information comes out, people will open their eyes and realize that Hillaryâ€™s â€œcampaignâ€ for votes is no different than any other self-serving racket she and her family have been involved in.
