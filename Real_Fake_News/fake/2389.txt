Unless you think â€œWhatâ€™s your favorite color?â€ is a hard question, you shouldnâ€™t expect much from lapdog press interviews of Statist candidates. 
In a Wall Street Journal column this morning, James Freeman, an editorial page editor, notes that getting candidates in races below Donald Trump on the Republican ticket to denounce him has become a regular sport in the media. But he wonders why reporters â€œdonâ€™t force down-ballot Democrats to take a position on each new Clinton email revelation.â€ 
That would be fine. Although there is nothing we didnâ€™t suspect, thanks to WikiLeaks, we have more details than ever about Clinton venality and political corruption. 
But there is a line of questioning that is even more important. 
Why shouldnâ€™t other candidates on the Democrat ticket be asked to endorse or disavow Hillaryâ€™s regime change wars in Libya and Syria? 
Shouldnâ€™t they be made to own the jihadist-generating carnage she champions? Wouldnâ€™t it be wise to tie political supporters to her war trajectory with Russia as well, so that if she has her way the survivors will know who was to blame? 1:20 pm on October 28, 2016
