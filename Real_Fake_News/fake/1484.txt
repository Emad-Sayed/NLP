After earning millions for fighting Floyd Mayweather, the boxer and politician used a portion of his earnings to construct homes for 1,000 poor families in his hometown. Manny Pacquiao is more than a world-class athlete or a Filipino politician. Heâ€™s a compassionate activist who paid for 1,000 homes to be built to help out underprivileged families in his hometown.

Earlier this year, Pacquiao proclaimed his good deed on Facebook: â€œIâ€™m so happy giving this houses free to my constituents in Sarangani Province from my own pocket more than thousand families are the beneficiaries.â€
The Star reports that the â€born-again Christianâ€™ was inspired to help poor families after duking it out with Floyd Mayweather. Though he lost the boxing match, he still earned millions of dollars in the â€fight of the centuryâ€™ and felt it was his duty to give back.
He wrote: 
â€œAs faithful stewards of Godâ€™s grace in its various forms, each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others. Iâ€™m still building more because I always believe what the bible says offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.â€
The act of compassion could be nothing more than a calculated political move, but nonetheless, 1,000 families have secure living spaces thanks to the Senatorâ€™s generosity. That, we believe, is worth celebrating.
