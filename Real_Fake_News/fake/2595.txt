Donâ€™t worry about Hillary: BuzzFeed confirms she remained totally super awesome while under siege Posted at 5:54 pm on October 29, 2016 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter 
Well, this wasnâ€™t altogether unexpected. After news broke Friday that the FBI had uncovered new information pertinent to its investigation into Hillary Clinton, it wasnâ€™t long before reporters, as predicted, began filing stories about Republicans â€œpouncingâ€ on the news . 
Thatâ€™s all well and good â€” everyone knew those mean Republicans would attack. As always, Clinton put up a brave front, challenging the FBI to go public with whatever it had, possibly including classified documents related to an ongoing federal investigation. 
But did anyone think to really check on the Democratic candidate? How was she holding up behind the scenes? Pretty well, it seems. BuzzFeedâ€™s Ruby Cramer provided readers with an insiderâ€™s look at Hillaryâ€™s super-weird day under siege. Your guide to the *weirdest* yet most totally normal day on the plane w/Clintonâ€”a candidate unfazed when under seige https://t.co/i3xwJ1T4Bn

So relax, everyone: thereâ€™s no need whatsoever to lose sleep on Clintonâ€™s behalf. Even while besieged by the continuing fallout of a scandal of her own making, she was â€œalmost bizarrely unfazed by crisis.â€ @rubycramer @maggieNYT this woman is tougher than any man i no of
