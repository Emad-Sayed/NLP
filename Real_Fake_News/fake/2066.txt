Protestants get ready to grovel By Gilad Atzmon Posted on November 9, 2016 by Gilad Atzmon 
This week we learned that Jewish institutions insist upon the Protestant Church apologising for its founderâ€™s views of the Jews. The Jewish Algemeiner writes that â€œthe 500th anniversary of the Reformation would be the â€perfect timeâ€™ for Protestant leaders to recognise and apologise for the â€horrific antisemitismâ€™ of their movementâ€™s founder, Martin Luther.â€ 
The truth of the matter is that Martin Luther didnâ€™t know about Zionism, Israeli criminality, Alan Dershowitz, Bernie Madoff, Jeffrey Epstein, or Sir Philip Green but he still had a serious problem with the Jews. Back in 1543 he wrote On The Jews and their Lies , a book notorious for its opposition to Jews and their religion. 
Rabbi Abraham Cooperâ€”associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Centreâ€”wants the Protestants to disown the founding father of their church or at least to â€œdirectly address the issue (of anti-Semitism) in the overall context of what theyâ€™re celebrating in terms of this anniversary,â€ 
David Michaels of Bâ€™nai Bâ€™rith insists that the churches reject some of their founderâ€™s teachings. â€œThis reality requires committed Lutherans and other Christians to ensure that there is fitting recognition and rejection of Lutherâ€™s hateful beliefs about Jews, wherever these persist.â€ 
The Protestant world is clearly being subjected to an institutionalized assault Judaism. But there is one thing the Jewish Algemeiner fails to do. It fails to brief us about Lutherâ€™s argument against the Jews. The truth of the matter is that Lutherâ€™s animus towards Jewry wasnâ€™t at all racially driven. His arguments against Jews were purely theological rather than biological. Thus, using the term â€anti-Semitismâ€™ in reference to Luther is misleading. It leaves one wondering whether Bnai Bâ€™rith and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre are lying consciously when they refer to Luther as an â€anti-Semiteâ€™? If they do, we may actually need to seek the assistance of Lutherâ€™s book in order to grasp Rabbi Cooper and Michaelsâ€™ conduct.
