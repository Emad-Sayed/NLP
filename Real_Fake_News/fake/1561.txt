Jon Rappoport â€“ Arianna Stassinopoulos, aka Huffington, is a Greek bearing gifts. For Hillary Clinton. 
The Huffington Post pretends itâ€™s doing objective journalism. Nice try. No one has believed in HuffPoâ€™s objectivity for a long time. But now we have an email that seals the deal. 
Zero Hedge reports : â€œâ€¦the latest Podesta dump from WikiLeaks fully exposes the blatant collusion in black and white. In the following email chain, when asked whether she would like to join the board of a pro-democrat media consortium, PMUSA, Ariana graciously declines saying that she could be more useful to the Clinton campaign by pushing its agenda through the Huffington Post â€œwithout any perceived conflictsâ€. â€œShe [Arianna] is enthusiastic abt the project but asks if sheâ€™s more useful to us not being on the Board and, instead, using Huffpo to echo our [pro-Hillary] message without any perceived conflicts. She has a point.â€ â€œThe sender of the email is none other than Susan McCue, the former chief of staff to [Democrat Senator] Harry Reid while the recipients include John Podesta [Hillaryâ€™s campaign chairman] and the ever controversial David Brock whose Super PAC, Correct the Record, has been sued for illegally coordinating with the Clinton campaign.â€ 
Well, isnâ€™t that wonderful. 
Arianna used to be married to Republican Congressman Michael Huffington. Then, she was a political conservative. After her divorce, from which she reportedly netted $25 million, she began to morph into a Progressive. With the financial ability to launch HuffPo, she kept on turning to the political Left. In the HuffPo merger with AOL, she came away with another $21 million. 
Her opponents have pinned several labels on her: â€œthe most upwardly mobile Greek since Icarus,â€ and â€œthe Sir Edmund Hillary of social climbing.â€ 
So now sheâ€™s an echo chamber for the Democratic Party. 
The Online Etymology Dictionary traces the root of â€œechoâ€: â€œâ€¦personified in classical [Greek] mythology as a mountain nymph who pined away for love of Narcissus until nothing was left of her but her voiceâ€¦â€ 
And now weâ€™ve confirmed for whom that Arianna-voice speaks. A great American narcissist, Hillary Clinton.
