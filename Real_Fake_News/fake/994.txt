Wikileaks Just Released Her Full Isis Donor List With Names! 
WikiLeaks just finished the job that started few months ago! Hillary just got killed! She is not going to survive this! Itâ€™s too much! Pure treason! 
According to Conservative Daily Post: Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are the founders of ISIS. We have proven that through emails and documents leaked from WikiLeaks, but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it. 
After all, they are still more focused on what Trump said eleven years ago than what Hillary has actually done. 
Because of brave patriots like Julian Assange, we have been given more evidence that Hillary Clinton is more connected to ISIS than we originally believed. 
An email was leaked between Clinton and John Podesta indicating that: â€œWestern intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the regionâ€ to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of â€œproviding clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.â€ 
Citing the need to â€œuse our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets,â€ said Hillary to Podesta while arguing the current developments in the Middle East were â€œimportant to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country.â€ 
Odd that Clinton argues Saudi Arabia and Qatar are helping fund ISIS when Hillaryâ€™s largest donations come from those two countries. 
In another correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai, set up a meeting with Bill Clinton for five minutes in exchange for a $1,000,000 â€œbirthday check.â€ 
The email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would â€œwelcome the Clinton Foundationâ€™s suggestions for investments in Haiti â€” particularly on education and health.â€ Desai added that while Qatar had already â€œallocated most of their $20 million â€¦ they were happy to consider projects we suggest.â€ Like this?
