Being an utter cock no barrier to success 09-11-16 THERE is no â€glass ceilingâ€™ for utter cocks any more, it has been confirmed. Donald Trumpâ€™s election success has been hailed as a victory by the cock, arsehole and bellend communities, who have for centuries struggled to gain acceptance in mainstream society. Total cock Roy Hobbs said: â€œFarage gave us hope, Trump has given us freedom. No longer will being an utter penis be frowned upon. â€œI can polish the â€No Turningâ€™ sign at the end of my driveway with pride, and drive my white 2011 BMW 7 Series right up anyoneâ€™s arse without fear of reproach. â€œThe world told me I was wrong. But I was right, or rather if I was wrong it doesnâ€™t matter any more. â€œI am an utter cock, hear my cry.â€
