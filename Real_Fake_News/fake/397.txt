15 years ago, I was the first one to import a high quality saturated fat called â€œVirgin Coconut Oilâ€ from the Philippines and market it in the U.S. market. Coconut oil is a traditional fat that has been consumed for thousand of years in tropical climates, where historically western diseases like heart disease, diabetes, obesity and others were not common, in spite of their high saturated fat diet. 
During World War II when the Japanese cut of the supply of the high saturated fat edible oils like coconut oil and palm oil with their occupation of the Philippines and other Southeastern nations, industry in the U.S. developed the â€œexpeller-pressedâ€ method of extracting oil from seeds that had not previously been a source of dietary oil, mainly the U.S. cash crops of soybeans and corn. These polyunsaturated oils were not shelf-stable edible oils, so the industrial process of â€œhomogenizationâ€ was developed to make them more shelf stable, and behave more like shelf-stable saturated fats. 
Politics, not science, influenced government agencies like the USDA to promote these new polyunsaturated oils as more healthy than saturated fats. A new dietary dogma of â€œlow-fatâ€ was developed, and history now shows that Americaâ€™s health greatly suffered as a result. Until even today, we have seen very high numbers of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease plaguing Americans. 
So it was with much opposition 15 years ago that I presented the real science behind coconut oil and saturated fats, but many now are waking up to the terrible consequences of following the government-sponsored low-fat diet dogma for so many years. 
One can truly turn their health around by simply making a dietary choice as to the types of fats one consumes, and increase the consumption of healthy fats, particularly when those fats in the diet replace harmful processed carbohydrates. The Science of Fats: Information that Could Change Your Life 
From November 7 â€“ 14 Dr. Mark Hyman , Dr. Carrie Diulus, and over 30 of the worldâ€™s top experts on fats will participate in an online FREE summit dispeling the biggest MYTHS about fat, and revealing the latest research about how to eat, move and supplement your diet for improved health and longevity. Join these world-renowned experts, such as Aseem Malhotra, MD (one of Britainâ€™s top cardiologists), Amy Myers, MD , Gary Taubes (famous science author that challenged mainstream mediaâ€™s dogma on fats), Sayer Ji (Founder of GreenMedInfo.com), best-selling author Nina Teicholz , Peter Attia, MD , and dozens of others! 
Thereâ€™s so much confusion and misinformation out there about FATâ€¦both the fat on our bodies, and the fats we eat. Youâ€™ve been told that eating fat makes you fat â€” and increases your risk for heart disease and other chronic illnesses â€” but fat is NOT the enemy. The truth is: eating MORE FAT can help shut down cravings, accelerate weight loss and potentially prevent or reverse disease.
