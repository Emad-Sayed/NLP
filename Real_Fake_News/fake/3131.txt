in: Government , Government Corruption , Obama Exposed , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests , Whistle Blowers Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are the founders of ISIS. We have proven that through emails and documents leaked from WikiLeaks, but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it. After all, they are still more focused on what Trump said eleven years ago than what Hillary has actually done. Because of brave patriots like Julian Assange, we have been given more evidence that Hillary Clinton is more connected to ISIS than we originally believed. An email was leaked between Clinton and John Podesta indicating that: â€œWestern intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the regionâ€ to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of â€œproviding clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.â€ Citing the need to â€œuse our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets,â€ said Hillary to Podesta while arguing the current developments in the Middle East were â€œimportant to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country.â€ Odd that Clinton argues Saudi Arabia and Qatar are helping fund ISIS when Hillaryâ€™s largest donations come from those two countries. She Is Funded By Nations That Fund ISIS. Coincidence? In another correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai , set up a meeting with Bill Clinton for five minutes in exchange for a $1,000,000 â€œbirthday check.â€ The email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would â€œwelcome [the Clinton Foundationâ€™s] suggestions for investments in Haiti â€” particularly on education and health.â€ Desai added that while Qatar had already â€œallocated most of their $20 million â€¦ [they were] happy to consider projects we suggest.â€ We now see two more examples of the Clintonâ€™s acting corrupt and being intertwined with nations that fund ISIS. For those that do not see where the dots connect, letâ€™s simplify how this all worked for Hillary. Hillary, as Secretary of State, would sell terrorist nations large weapons deals only after they gave her a very generous donation to her â€œfoundation.â€ These weapons, provided by Hillary and her State Department, then filtered down from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya, and so on to create, supply, and bolster terrorist groups. That is exactly how ISIS was created. But instead of blowing them up with an air assault, Hillary and Obama decided to leave ISIS alone. Why? Because ISIS being in the Middle East allows the Obama/Clinton machine to make millions in personal profits from these nations in a repetitive cycle of selling weapons. They are choosing personal gain over eliminating a terrorist group. Let that sink in. Why else have they not arrested Hillary for all of these crimes? The FBI would arrest you in a heartbeat if you went to Facebook right now to praise Allah and ISIS. It also speaks volumes as to why they are trying so hard to silence Julian Assange.
