Search Election Law Violation Was Hillaryâ€™s Idea Orders to use Donald Duck to foment violence at Trump rallies came straight from the top. October 27, 2016 Matthew Vadum 
Democrat Hillary Clinton personally authorized illegal dirty tricks operations against Republican Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign, according to top Democrats appearing in undercover video. 
In the third Hillary-related video released by ACORN slayer James Oâ€™Keefe and his Project Veritas Action Fund this past Sunday (Oct. 23), Clinton is directly implicated in a scheme to use Donald Duck to mock Trump and troll his supporters at Trump campaign rallies. 
Among Disney cartoon characters Donald Duck was a natural choice. After all, his name used to appear regularly on voter registration documents when Bill and Hillary Clintonâ€™s favorite community organizing group, the now-defunct ACORN, hired hobos and felons to go on voter-registration drives. 
Earlier this year Democrats in Donald Duck costumes started appearing at Trump events across America. Costumed individuals would walk around carrying signs. One said, â€œTrump ducks releasing his tax return.â€ 
This cutesy publicity stunt isnâ€™t necessarily the problem, though. The problem is that Hillary Clinton ordered it and apparently broke the law by coordinating with a tax-exempt nonprofit group. 
Prominent in the video is political organizer Robert Creamer who is very high up in the Democratic Partyâ€™s hierarchy. He has reportedly visited the Obama White House 342 times, including 47 meetings with Obama personally. 
One of the visits took place in Obamaâ€™s personal living quarters. 
â€œItâ€™s a very big deal that Creamer visited the presidentâ€™s residence in the White House,â€ a former senior White House employee told FrontPage in an interview. â€œWhite House employees can work there for years and never visit the residence.â€ 
Creamer, a practitioner of the agitation arts taught by Marxist community organizing guru Saul Alinsky, is husband tof Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a socialist and advocate of single-payer health care. Creamer is considered by many to be the legislative architect of Obamacare. He also wrote a series of bad checks to cover his salary at a nonprofit and went to prison. Prosecutors wanted to send him up the river for 37 months but he got off with merely five months and 11 months of home confinement from a friendly Democrat judge. 
Creamer is a founder of the unsavory political consulting firm Democracy Partners . The list of â€œpartnersâ€ on the companyâ€™s website is a whoâ€™s who of elite Democratic Party power players. 
In addition to Creamer, the partners are: 
Midwest Academy founder Heather Booth ; website developer Marc Cerabona ; organizer Wyatt Closs ; SEIU veteran Mac Dâ€™Alessandro ; Maccabee Group founder Brett C. Di Resta ; CrossCurrents Foundation co-founder Ken Grossinger ; former Media Matters for America online organizer David Grossman ; former SEIU national field director for politics John Hennelly ; strategic communications advisor Marilyn Katz ; organizer Jackie Kendall ; strategist Lupe Lopez ; political consultant Mike Lux ; strategic advisor Josie Mooney ; consultant Patrick Pannett ; organizer Christine Pelosi (her mother is House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi); USAction president Khalid Pitts ; former DNC general counsel Joe Sandler ; consultant Linda Saucedo ; fundraiser Renee Schaeffer ; former New Organizing Institute senior fellow Joel Silberman ; and organizer Cheri Whiteman . 
Listed as â€œassociatesâ€ are Lauren Windsor , executive director of American Family Voices, and Aaron Black , who appears in the undercover videos. Black describes himself in the footage as â€œbasically deputy rapid response director for the DNC on the ground at Trump events,â€ adding â€œnobodyâ€™s supposed to know about me.â€ 
(FrontPage published an article yesterday examining Democracy Partners.) 
For a master practitioner of fascistic tactics, Creamer is amazingly lacking in self-awareness (or just plain dishonest). He wrote a fatuous, ahistorical op-ed in the Huffington Post earlier this year titled â€œCan Fascism Triumph in America?â€ 
â€œLike other fascist movements, Trump says out loud -- and legitimates -- the kind of hateful, violent language that was previously whispered only in the privacy of people's living rooms.â€ 
Bear in mind that quite apart from his mischaracterization of Trumpâ€™s public statements, Creamer is shown in the videos masterminding an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents. 
Fomenting and carrying out acts of violence against political opponents was what the fascist Third Reich did, using the Sturmabteiling or S.A., also called brown shirts and storm troopers. Ditto for Mussoliniâ€™s Squadristi (black shirts), Maoâ€™s Red Guards, Iranâ€™s Basij , and Haitiâ€™s Tonton Macoute . 
Creamer explains the Donald Duck action in the third video. 
â€œIn the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground,â€ Creamer says in one of several exchanges. â€œSo, by God, we would get ducks on the ground.â€ 
Creamer makes it clear he knows that this coordination between his consulting firm, Democracy Partners, and the campaign was a huge legal landmine when he said: â€œDonâ€™t repeat that to anybody.â€ 
â€œThe whole duck thing? That came about, the reason we moved it from DNC to [Americans United for Change] was to just do a hopscotch, but the actual idea was hatched way back in May,â€ Creamer associate Scott Foval said, making a pun. 
â€œThe duck has to be an Americans United for Change entity,â€ Creamer said. â€œThis had to do only with some problem between [now acting DNC chief] Donna Brazile and ABC, which is owned by Disney, because they were worried about a trademark issue. Thatâ€™s why. Itâ€™s really silly.â€ 
We originally launched this duck because Hillary Clinton wants the duck. In any case, so she really wanted this duck figure out there doing stuff, so that was fine. So, we put all these ducks out there and got a lot of coverage. And Trump taxes. And then ABC/Disney went crazy because they thought our original slogan was â€Donald ducks his taxes, releasing his tax returns.â€™ 
Creamer is shown in the video hoping Disney would file a lawsuit against Democrats for using Donald Duck in the campaign, likely because such a thing would generate publicity. 
â€œLet them sue us. Please God,â€ he says, looking to the heavens and clasping his hands together as if in prayer. â€œI doubt they will because weâ€™re paying to rent or buy the suits, thatâ€™s where they get their license fees. Weâ€™re not using it for commercial purposes.â€ 
The Wall Street Journal reported Aug. 18 that â€â€œDonald ducksâ€™ was the creation of the Democratic National Committee.â€ Then on Sept. 8 the paper reported the DNC â€œis no longer associated with the duck â€¦ Americans United for Change is now managing the duck â€¦â€ 
But out of public view the DNC and the Clinton campaign were still controlling the duck operation, breaking federal campaign coordination laws, Oâ€™Keefe says in narrating the third video. 
â€œWe kind of divvy up responsibilities. So sometimes it will be, like, campaign owned,â€ said Jenna Price, assistant press secretary at the DNC. â€œSo sometimes you will see that they advised something, or they are taking credit for things. So, like, we arenâ€™t taking credit for the duck anymore. Thatâ€™s like, random ally groups. But itâ€™s still something that weâ€™re involved in.â€ 
Brad Woodhouse, president of Americans United for Change, expected the presence of the duck at events would spark violence. â€œI think this duck is going to get roughed up somewhere.â€ 
In one segment, Foval says, â€œI almost got punched on Monday morning, I mean, I was in a duck costume.â€ 
The nationâ€™s campaign coordination laws were enacted after President Richard Nixonâ€™s Watergate scandal, Oâ€™Keefe notes. 
For an activity to violate the law it must meet a three-part test, he explains. 
First, there must be payment by someone other than the candidate for election-related activity. Second, a campaign has to be materially involved in shaping communications for a third party group. And third, electoral advocacy has to take place close to an election. 
Oâ€™Keefe continues: 
The payment [prong of the test] is complicated but just the fact that Foval, a paid employee of Americans United for Change, was the duck at some events constitutes payment by AUfC. Conduct, based on their own admission the campaign, Creamer, their agent, and AUfC coordinated the duck activities. And finally content. â€Donald ducksâ€™ is undeniably political content directed against one candidate for the sole purpose of helping another. 
The fourth video, released yesterday, isnâ€™t so much an expose of wrongdoing but it does provide ample evidence of Creamerâ€™s ties to the Clinton campaign and to President Obama himself. 
In a phone call Creamer says â€œI spend most of my time overseeing the Trump events around the country. I mean, thatâ€™s what I do for the Clinton campaign, uh, so thatâ€™s interesting as well.â€ 
In another scene when an undercover reporter phones saying he needs an immigration lawyer with powerful connections for a wealthy client in Syria, Creamer makes it clear he is happy to help by reaching out to Obama's inner circle. 
I just need to, I will try and find a couple of good referrals to you and get back to you pretty quick then. Okay? â€¦ On the first, well, Iâ€™ll just talk, the guy Iâ€™m going to talk to first, to see if this is up his alley, the first thing is up his alley. Itâ€™s the guy who ran the campaign for President Obama. He has a firm thatâ€™s pretty well connected. 
In another setting, Creamer says: 
Hereâ€™s what I do for the Clinton campaign by the way. Iâ€™m a consultant to the Clinton campaign. Wherever Trump or Pence go in the country, we make sure that there are press events in the TV market or whatever â€¦ whether theyâ€™re big turnouts or little turnouts, whatever, that drive our message wherever the candidate goes to drive his message. So that on any given day they will be between them probably in six places. So our team makes sure there are events in all those six places every day. So it is a lot of events, and we try and help define the other candidate. 
â€œEvery morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters,â€ added Creamer. 
He continued: 
Iâ€™m in this campaign mainly to deal with what, you know, earned media, with the television, radio. With earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising. There would be a whole different advertising â€¦ everybody is driven on the same tracks, though. So then there are a couple, a bunch of people in the Brooklyn office [of the Clinton campaign] that are responsible for possible aspects of communication. Like, we do rapid response and there is a guy there I work with heavily, is the guy that I was just communicating with on that kind of stuff. For instance, we just found, I just sent him a note beforehand when we came here that said, â€My understanding is there might be another revelation of another woman talking about Trump this afternoon.â€™ 
Creamer bragged again about his ties to President Obama. 
Oh Barack Obamaâ€™s was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good too. I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect. 
Obama is â€œa pro,â€ Creamer said. â€œIâ€™ve known the president since he was a community organizer in Chicago.â€ 
I was just at an event with him in Chicago actually, on Friday last. He is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the, the health care bill, trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues. 
The second video , released Oct. 18, was a primer on how Democrats get away with massive voter fraud. 
â€œItâ€™s a very easy thing for Republicans to say, well theyâ€™re bussing people in,â€ said Scott Foval, then national field director for Americans United for Change. 
Well you know what? Weâ€™ve been bussing people in to deal with you fuckinâ€™ assholes for 50 years and weâ€™re not going to stop now â€“ weâ€™re just going to find a different way to do it. So, I mean I grew up with that idea. They used to bus people out to Iowa. If we needed people out there weâ€™d bus people out to Iowa. 
In a discussion Oâ€™Keefe described as focusing on bringing people from one state to another state to vote illegally, Foval, who also worked as deputy political director at George Soros-funded People for the American Way (PfAW), explains how to get away with voter fraud. 
Instead of bussing people in, it is better to have them travel in their own personal vehicles, he said. 
Would they charge each individual of voter fraud? Or are they going to go after the facilitator for conspiracy, which they could prove? Itâ€™s one thing if all these people drive up in their personal cars. If thereâ€™s a bus involved? That changes the dynamic. 
â€œItâ€™s the legality, because you can prove conspiracy if thereâ€™s a bus,â€ he said. â€œIf there are cars itâ€™s much harder to prove â€¦ if thereâ€™s enough money you have people drive their POVs [personally owned vehicles] or you can have them drive rentals.â€ 
Foval says itâ€™s easy to keep the voter fraud operation a secret. â€œSo you use shells. Use shell companies.â€ 
Democrats are untouchable, he said. â€œThe question is, whether when you get caught by a reporter, does that matter? Because does it turn into an investigation or not? In this case, this state, the answer is no, because they donâ€™t have any power to do anything.â€ 
Foval explained in the first video how pro-Clinton super PACs communicate with each other and how their information finds its way to the DNC, presumably a violation of federal law. 
â€œI guaran-damn-tee you that the people who run the super PACs all talk to each other and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication.â€ 
â€œWeâ€™re consultants,â€ Foval says, â€œso weâ€™re not the official entity and so those conversations can be had between consultants who are working for different parts.â€ 
He adds: 
The thing that we have to watch is making sure there is a double blind between the actual campaign and the actual DNC and what weâ€™re doing. Thereâ€™s a double blind there. So they can plausibly deny that they knew anything about it. 
The Clinton campaign â€œis fully in it,â€ veteran left-wing strategist Robert Creamer confirms on hidden camera. â€œHillary knows through the chain of command whatâ€™s going on.â€ 
Oâ€™Keefeâ€™s group, Project Veritas Action Fund, filed a formal complaint against the Clinton campaign with the Federal Election Commission last week. 
The complaint states that Project Veritas: 
uncovered a criminal conspiracy where, in the words of Scott Foval, â€The way it works is: The [Hillary for America] campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays The Foval Group, The Foval Group goes and executes â€¦ on the ground.â€™ This has been done in a manner to evade federal election law and violating coordinated expenditures rules. 
The complaint also accuses Priorities USA Action, Alliance for Retired Americans, Americans United for Change, and the Democratic National Committee of accepting â€œprohibited and excessive contributions in the form of coordinated expendituresâ€ contrary to federal law and regulations. 
The first undercover video Oâ€™Keefe released sent shock waves through the political community. 
In that video , released Oct. 17, we learned that the frequent outbursts of violence at Republican candidate Trumpâ€™s campaign rallies have been orchestrated and paid for by Clintonâ€™s campaign. 
The idea was to foment violent at Trump rallies in order to create the false impression that his campaign and supporters were violent crazy people and at the same time provide evidence to support the Leftâ€™s predetermined narrative that the billionaire businessman is a dangerous fascist. 
Such behavior constitutes terrorism, Austin Bay writes at the Observer : 
Creamer ran what amounts to a domestic U.S. political terror and propaganda operation dedicated to undermining the 2016 U.S. presidential electionâ€”â€œrigging the election,â€ to use the current term. [â€¦] 
The election rigging scheme he commanded relies on street thuggery. That means physical fearâ€”terrorâ€”is a core component of Americans United for Changeâ€™s crooked enterprise. Street thuggery is very low-level terrorism, but it is a type of terrorism nonetheless and it is wrong to call it otherwise. Hardboy muscle, bottles and two by fours are street thuggeryâ€™s kinetics. Bottles and baseball bats are not Al Qaedaâ€™s high explosivesâ€”but they incite fear and when they crack heads they cause casualties. People bleed. Street thuggery as an arm of politics is violent, criminalized politics on an ugly downward slope to much worse, the worse including lynchings and pogroms. If you donâ€™t think street thuggery is terror then consider Kristalnacht. 
And Oâ€™Keefe isnâ€™t finished with the Hillary Clinton campaign yet. 
â€œOur lawyers won't let us release all our @HillaryClinton & DNC footage[,]â€O'Keefe tweeted Tuesday. â€œFor those demanding full raw [footage], be VERY careful what you wish for.â€
