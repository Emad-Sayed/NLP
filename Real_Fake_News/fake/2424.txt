Iâ€™m not one to shy away from Hillary Clinton related controversies, but this whole Spirit Cooking topic just seemed too far over the top to not have a good explanation. As such, Iâ€™ve avoided writing about it, hoping that someone from the Clinton team would come out and put all the craziness to rest. That has not happened. 
Indeed, the topic was trending at #1 for much of the morning on Twitter, and continues to trend at #3 many hours later. All day, Iâ€™ve been trying as hard as possible to disassociate my confirmation bias about the Clintons, from this story. As such, Iâ€™ve been waiting for a good â€œdebunkingâ€ piece to come out, but have yet to see one. 
For those of you who are interested in the topic, hereâ€™s a measured take from The Washington Times : 
A new WikiLeaks release of stolen emails belonging to Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman John Podesta reveal an invitation by his brother to a â€œSpirit Cooking dinnerâ€ at the home of artist Marina Abramovic. 
â€œSpirit Cooking with Essential Aphrodisiac Recipesâ€ was released by Ms. Abramovic in 1996, but the â€œingredientsâ€ call for â€œfresh breast milk with fresh sperm milkâ€ to be consumed â€œon earthquake nights.â€ 
New Yorkâ€™s Museum of Modern Art called it a â€œcookbookâ€ for â€œevocative instructions for actions or thoughts.â€ Another recipe calls for â€œfresh morning urine.â€ 
â€œAre you in NYC Thursday July 9 Marina wants you to come to dinner Mary?â€ Tony Podesta says in an email forwarded to his brother June 28, 2015. 
â€œDear Tony, I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place,â€ Ms. Abramovic says in a June 25 email sent at 2:35 a.m. GMT +2. â€œDo you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? All my love, Marina.â€ 
You can see the source email through the following tweet by Wikileaks: Tony Podesta.
