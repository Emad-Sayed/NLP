A GROUP of over a thousand civilians fleeing from the civil war in Syria have taken the time to pull off one of the best mannequin challenges weâ€™ve ever seen, in a 4-minute video lighting the internet on fire right now! 
The mannequin challenge, the latest craze sweeping through social media platforms at the minute, involves groups of people posing stock-still as a camera roves around them, with everyone from the Portuguese football team to Michelle Obama to a group of lads at a house party in Stillorgan taking part. 
All those videos pale in comparison, however, to the epic one-take shot filmed in the war-torn region of Aleppo in which 976 men, women, children and babies are shown staying perfectly still, with poses ranging from â€œhalf-buried underneath a collapsed hospitalâ€ to â€œclutching throat as the lungs fill with chlorine gasâ€. 
â€œWith the mannequin challenge, youâ€™ll always see one person blink or sway, but not in this one,â€ posted Mark Lennings, a 26-year-old internet user who shared the video on his Facebook page. 
â€œYouâ€™d nearly swear they were actually mannequins. But that canâ€™t be the case, because if this kind of thing was really happening to these people, weâ€™d be talking about it more than weâ€™re talking about a viral game that serves only to fill our timelines with nonsense so we donâ€™t have to cope with the realities of this world. In fact, itâ€™s the best viral video to come out of the country since the ice-bucket challenge they filmed in the Mediterranean last yearâ€. 
It is really up there with the best weâ€™ve seen, to view the epic video, click HERE.
