It isnâ€™t gang violence. It isnâ€™t even domestic violence. What is the leading cause of murder in Carson City? According to Sheriff Ken Furlong, itâ€™s marijuana. 
â€œItâ€™s against that law,â€ Furlong told local ABC affiliate, KOLO 8. â€œIt does change peopleâ€™s attitude and we do see people dying as a result of it, needlessly, and thereâ€™s no excuse for it. 
â€œIn the last 13-15 years, all of the violence weâ€™ve seen that has turned deadly, have [sic] been in someway related to a marijuana issue.â€ 
Before you get too excited, thinking Furlong nailed it â€” the fact cannabis remains a federal Schedule 1 drug and thus technically illegal in the ongoing yet utterly failed war on drugs â€” that isnâ€™t all he had to say on the matter. 
KOLO 8 noted the 2016 deaths of 18-year-old Grant Watkins and 40-year-old Dennis Watkins, Jr. â€” both killed during transactions involving the sale of cannabis. 
â€œDuring a transaction, they set it up, â€Iâ€™m going to sell this to you,â€™ then all of a sudden someone gets shot and killed,â€ Furlong continued. â€œItâ€™s not because they were under the influence; itâ€™s because they were doing something deadly and it turned out that way.â€ 
As Furlong explained, the threat to life isnâ€™t due to the drugâ€™s effects on the system, per se , but the â€culture and crimesâ€™ surrounding it â€that can be overwhelming,â€™ as KOLO 8 paraphrased. 
â€œItâ€™s a very cherished culture and people have very strong beliefs,â€ the Sheriff elaborated. â€œWhen you violate someoneâ€™s beliefs, you put them in a position where they can act out.â€ 
But Furlongâ€™s complete lack of understanding of all things cannabis â€” including both medicinal and recreational aspects â€” didnâ€™t stop there. According to the Sheriff, the community faces repercussions following a law enforcement drug bust â€” because addicts suddenly have no way to procure their â€¦ cannabis. 
â€œWeâ€™re watching very closely, not only for a spike in crime, but for people who are in critical need of medical care because of that lack of treatment, based on withdrawal from the drug,â€ he asserted. 
Yes, you read that right. Carson Cityâ€™s Sheriff-in-charge firmly believes depriving people of cannabis â€” a plant scientifically and anecdotally proven to save lives â€” will lead to a crime wave and health crisis of no small proportions. 
But what he explained next, as paraphrased by KOLO 8, harkens back to the earliest days of cannabis prohibition and the propagandist classic, Reefer Madness: 
â€Sheriff Furlong says unlike other drugs like heroin or methamphetamines that can distort your mind, people using marijuana usually have rational trains of thought which give them the ability to act out and become violent when someone takes away or violates their drug.â€™ 
At this point, if youâ€™re having a good laugh, stunned, or shaking your head, you most certainly are not alone. 
Obviously, Sheriff Furlong grasps the potential perils in black market trade â€” but he wholly fails to recognize removing cannabisâ€™ illegality would thus remove the risk of violence. When the State is removed from consensual business transactions, individuals are free to conduct trade as they see fit â€” if cannabis were abundant and legal, it would be highly unlikely people would continue killing each other over soured deals. 
But Furlongâ€™s stupefying lack of knowledge concerning the effects cannabis has on the body, though certainly laughable, also should concern the residents heâ€™s tasked with overseeing. 
Mischaracterizing cannabis so broadly as to believe it will warp peopleâ€™s minds to a heightened frenzy where theyâ€™re likely to commit violence is downright dangerous. 
For one thing, this inexcusable misperception could color the training Sheriff Furlong decides to give law enforcement trainees and officers. Considering the absolutely epidemic national spate of violence inflicted by trigger-happy cops who already seem to have an irrational fear of the public, training them to further view cannabis users as likely to act out physically is nothing short of dangerous. 
If sheriffâ€™s deputies conduct a raid on a residence known for cannabis transactions with the preconception the people inside could turn violent instantly, itâ€™s arguable they would be more likely to misinterpret anything they encounter. This unnecessarily heightened fear that their life could be in peril from a cannabis-crazed maniac would have obvious influence on their decisions for whether or not to employ deadly force. 
Sadly, Sheriff Furlong likely isnâ€™t alone among law enforcement in the United States. As long as the drug war remains firmly entrenched in policy and culture, dangerous misunderstandings and lack of knowledge will arguably be the greater source of violence than would the substances be were they not illegal. 
In the meantime, while forced to pick apart drug laws state by state, perhaps drug and cannabis education â€” not fear- and prohibition-based propaganda, but serious education â€” should be mandatory in law enforcement training. Share Google + Lannim 
All he did, without knowing it, was admit that the real criminals are the ones who enforce prohibition and create this culture of violence. When you suppress a legitimate market it will be replaced by a black market that is regulated by force instead of voluntary interaction. Violence begets violence, and it doesnâ€™t get any more violent than the state. ACAB Matt Agorist 
EXACTLY! James Michael 
Considering the government never created a constitutional amendment allowing prohibition the entire drug war is treason and feloniusâ€¦. EVERY killing a murderâ€¦. EVERY raid a felony home invasionâ€¦. EVERY jailing a false imprisonmentâ€¦. EVERY fine extortionâ€¦â€¦ The cops and the courts are a criminal enterpriseâ€¦. AKA RICOâ€¦.. and meet the definition of it perfectlyâ€¦. Lannim 
Exactly. I would say that the drug war would be just as illegitimate and criminal with an amendment, but being able to argue that itâ€™s ALSO unconstitutional helps, considering most Americans think their rights are contingent upon whatâ€™s written on sacred documents. b4integrity 
The federal government is a continuing, criminal, domestic, terrorist enterprise. 
We need a DEA eradication program. Paschn 
Goddamn it does my old heart good to see folks lay things out as you did! Couple that with SCOTUSâ€™ treason with corporate citizenship, Patriot act, Habeas corpus gone, Posse Comitatus, gone granting civil immunity to big pharma, setting up a federal committee to â€œreviewâ€ claims made by citizens harmed by â€œsafeâ€ vaccines, then paying off those claims WITH TAX PAYER MONEY to protect the bottom line of the elitesâ€¦. Murdering Ranchers for pointing out the FEDâ€™s treason.. Let us not forget the 2 sets of books most governments run (CAFR). Let me know when you folks have had enough SEWER NATION â€“ IDIOT CULTURE.

This is easy to solve. end the criminal part of this. There is no need for marijuana to be illegal. You want to end drug deals and guns get the cops out of the equation and nobody needs to play this mob games. Gregory Pius 
We did that in Oregon and Washington. Tax revenues are bursting the state coffers, and the police now have to find honest work (or at least overzealously enforce something else). Everybody wins. Sadly, almost all LEOs Iâ€™ve ever heard to talked to have a deeply-held conviction that legalization of cannabis will result in the loss of their job. A â€¦ kaynash 
We have far too many ignorant people in positions of powerâ€¦..of course our press doesnâ€™t help either, they are just as ignorant, so no one is getting educated from that source any longer. But really, a Sheriff? If you are going to criminalize people, you should have a much better understanding of what you are saying. Because thinking people in law enforcement are more than aware that itâ€™s criminalizing drugs that is the problemâ€¦.and this guy actually comes close to realizing that and then draws the totally wrong conclusions from it. dufas_duck

Sounds like he described the average policemanâ€¦â€¦.. Gregory Pius
