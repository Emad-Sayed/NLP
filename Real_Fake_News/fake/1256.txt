In a highly controversial decision, the Louisiana Supreme Court has ruled that Catholic priests are not â€œmandatory reportersâ€ of child abuse they are made privy to as a result of administering sacramental confessions. 
According to Patheos , the ruling references article 609 A(1) of the Louisiana Childrenâ€™s Code: 
With respect to mandatory reporters: Notwithstanding any claim of privileged communication, any mandatory reporter who has cause to believe that a childâ€™s physical or mental health or welfare is endangered as a result of abuse or neglect or that abuse or neglect was a contributing factor in a childâ€™s death shall report in accordance with Article 610. 
The Oct. 28 ruling states in part: 
â€¦ any communication made to a priest privately in the sacrament of confession for the purpose of confession, repentance, and absolution is a confidential communication under La. Code Evid. 511, and the priest is exempt from mandatory reporter status in such circumstances by operation of La. Child. Code art. 603, because â€œunder the â€¦ tenets of the [Roman Catholic] churchâ€ he has an inviolable â€œduty to keep such communications confidential.â€ 
The case which originally brought this issue before the court was that of a young woman who told a Baton Rouge-area Catholic priest that a longtime parishioner had sexually assaulted her when she was 14-years-old. The priest in turn did not report the abuse.
