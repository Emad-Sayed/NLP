The United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the worldâ€™s â€œgold standardâ€ that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The â€œwise menâ€ of the system simply insist otherwise.
We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizensâ€™ judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000).

Strangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. Protecting the perceived integrity of the U.S. democratic process is paramount. Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated.
The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nationâ€™s leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized.
Of course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldnâ€™t vote).
That unsavory deal enabled Thomas Jefferson to defeat John Adams in the pivotal national election of 1800. In effect, the votes of Southern slave owners like Jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of Northern non-slave owners.
Even after the Civil War when the Constitution was amended to give black men voting rights, the reality for black voting, especially in the South, was quite different from the new constitutional mandate. Whites in former Confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century.
Women did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment, and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that Southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks.
Indeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedyâ€™s vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the Southâ€™s heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners.
However, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixonâ€™s Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960.
Nixonâ€™s â€Treasonâ€™ So, by 1968, the Democratsâ€™ once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didnâ€™t want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that â€” with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided â€” President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam.

The documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, Nixonâ€™s campaign went behind Johnsonâ€™s back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnsonâ€™s Paris peace talks by refusing to attend. Nixonâ€™s emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South Vietnam.
Though Johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called Nixonâ€™s â€œtreasonâ€ â€” from FBI wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election â€” he and his top advisers chose to stay silent. In a Nov. 4, 1968 conference call , Secretary of State Dean Rusk, National Security Advisor Walt Rostow and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford â€“ three pillars of the Establishment â€“ expressed that consensus, with Clifford explaining the thinking:
â€œSome elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that Iâ€™m wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual [Nixon] elected,â€ Clifford said. â€œIt could cast his whole administration under such doubt that I think it would be inimical to our countryâ€™s interests.â€
Cliffordâ€™s words expressed the recurring thinking whenever evidence emerged casting the integrity of Americaâ€™s electoral system in doubt, especially at the presidential level. The American people were not to know what kind of dirty deeds could affect that process.
To this day, the major U.S. news media will not directly address the issue of Nixonâ€™s treachery in 1968, despite the wealth of evidence proving this historical reality now available from declassified records at the Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas. In a puckish recognition of this ignored history, the libraryâ€™s archivists call the file on Nixonâ€™s sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks their â€œX-file.â€ [For details, see Consortiumnews.comâ€™s â€œ LBJâ€™s â€X-Fileâ€™ on Nixonâ€™s â€Treason. â€™â€]
The evidence also strongly suggests that Nixonâ€™s paranoia about a missing White House file detailing his â€œtreasonâ€ â€“ top secret documents that Johnson had entrusted to Rostow at the end of LBJâ€™s presidency â€“ led to Nixonâ€™s creation of the â€œplumbers,â€ a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers. The existence of the â€œplumbersâ€ became public in June 1972 when they were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committeeâ€™s headquarters at the Watergate in Washington.

Although the Watergate scandal remains the archetypal case of election-year dirty tricks, the major U.S. news media never acknowledge the link between Watergate and Nixonâ€™s far more egregious dirty trick four years earlier, sinking Johnsonâ€™s Vietnam peace talks while 500,000 American soldiers were in the war zone. In part because of Nixonâ€™s sabotage â€” and his promise to Thieu of a more favorable outcome â€” the war continued for four more bloody years before being settled along the lines that were available to Johnson in 1968. [See Consortiumnews.comâ€™s â€œ The Heinous Crime Behind Watergate .â€]
In effect, Watergate gets walled off as some anomaly that is explained by Nixonâ€™s strange personality. However, even though Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, he and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, who also had a hand in the Paris peace talk caper, reappear as secondary players in the next well-documented case of obstructing a sitting presidentâ€™s foreign policy to get an edge in the 1980 campaign.
Reaganâ€™s â€October Surpriseâ€™ Caper In that case, President Jimmy Carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 American hostages then held in revolutionary Iran. Ronald Reaganâ€™s campaign feared that Carter might pull off an â€œOctober Surpriseâ€ by bringing home the hostages just before the election. So, this historical mystery has been: Did Reaganâ€™s team take action to block Carterâ€™s October Surprise?
President Ronald Reagan, delivering his Inaugural Address on Jan. 20, 1981, as the 52 U.S. hostages in Iran are simultaneously released.
The testimonial and documentary evidence that Reaganâ€™s team did engage in a secret operation to prevent Carterâ€™s October Surprise is now almost as overwhelming as the proof of the 1968 affair regarding Nixonâ€™s Paris peace talk maneuver.
That evidence indicates that Reaganâ€™s campaign director William Casey organized a clandestine effort to prevent the hostagesâ€™ release before Election Day, after apparently consulting with Nixon and Kissinger and aided by former CIA Director George H.W. Bush, who was Reaganâ€™s vice presidential running mate.
By early November 1980, the publicâ€™s obsession with Iranâ€™s humiliation of the United States and Carterâ€™s inability to free the hostages helped turn a narrow race into a Reagan landslide. When the hostages were finally let go immediately after Reaganâ€™s inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, his supporters cited the timing to claim that the Iranians had finally relented out of fear of Reagan.
Bolstered by his image as a tough guy, Reagan enacted much of his right-wing agenda, including passing massive tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, weakening unions and creating the circumstances for the rapid erosion of the Great American Middle Class.
Behind the scenes, the Reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to Iran, mostly through Israel, what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for Iranâ€™s cooperation in getting Reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inauguration.

In summer 1981, when Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East Nicholas Veliotes learned about the arms shipments to Iran, he checked on their origins and said, later in a PBS interview:
â€œIt was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American-origin military equipment. â€¦ [This operation] seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration. And I understand some contacts were made at that time.â€
Those early covert arms shipments to Iran evolved into a later secret set of arms deals that surfaced in fall 1986 as the Iran-Contra Affair, with some of the profits getting recycled back to Reaganâ€™s beloved Nicaraguan Contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaraguaâ€™s leftist government.
While many facts of the Iran-Contra scandal were revealed by congressional and special-prosecutor investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the origins of the Reagan-Iran relationship was always kept hazy. The Republicans were determined to stop any revelations about the 1980 contacts, but the Democrats were almost as reluctant to go there.
A half-hearted congressional inquiry was launched in 1991 and depended heavily on then-President George H.W. Bush to collect the evidence and arrange interviews for the investigation. In other words, Bush, who was then seeking reelection and who was a chief suspect in the secret dealings with Iran, was entrusted with proving his own guilt.
Tired of the Story By the early 1990s, the mainstream U.S. news media was also tired of the complex Iran-Contra scandal and wanted to move on. As a correspondent at Newsweek, I had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before I left the magazine in 1990. I then received an assignment from PBS Frontline to look into the 1980 â€œOctober Surpriseâ€ question, which led to a documentary on the subject in April 1991.
PBS Frontlineâ€™s: The Election Held Hostage, co-written by Robert Parry and Robert Ross.
However, by fall 1991, just as Congress was agreeing to open an investigation, my ex-bosses at Newsweek, along with The New Republic, then an elite neoconservative publication interested in protecting Israelâ€™s exposure on those early arms deals, went on the attack. They published matching cover stories deeming the 1980 â€œOctober Surpriseâ€ case a hoax, but their articles were both based on a misreading of documents recording Caseyâ€™s attendance at a conference in London in July 1980, which he seemed to have used as a cover for a side trip to Madrid to meet with senior Iranians regarding the hostages.
Although the bogus Newsweek/New Republic â€œLondon alibiâ€ would eventually be debunked, it created a hostile climate for the investigation. With Bush angrily denying everything and the congressional Republicans determined to protect the Presidentâ€™s flanks, the Democrats mostly just went through the motions of an investigation.
Meanwhile, Bushâ€™s State Department and White House counselâ€™s office saw their jobs as discrediting the investigation, deep-sixing incriminating documents, and helping a key witness dodge a congressional subpoena.
Years later, I discovered a document at the Bush presidential library in College Station, Texas, confirming that Casey had taken a mysterious trip to Madrid in 1980. The U.S. Embassyâ€™s confirmation of Caseyâ€™s trip was passed along by State Department legal adviser Edwin D. Williamson to Associate White House Counsel Chester Paul Beach Jr. in early November 1991, just as the congressional inquiry was taking shape.
Williamson said that among the State Department â€œmaterial potentially relevant to the October Surprise allegations [was]a cable from the Madrid embassy indicating that Bill Casey was in town, for purposes unknown,â€ Beach noted in a â€œ memorandum for record â€ dated Nov. 4, 1991.
Two days later, on Nov. 6, Beachâ€™s boss, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, convened an inter-agency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the October Surprise case. The explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt President Bushâ€™s reelection hopes in 1992.

At the meeting, Gray laid out how to thwart the October Surprise inquiry, which was seen as a dangerous expansion of the Iran-Contra investigation. The prospect that the two sets of allegations would merge into a single narrative represented a grave threat to George H.W. Bushâ€™s reelection campaign. As assistant White House counsel Ronald vonLembke, put it , the White House goal in 1991 was to â€œkill/spike this story.â€
Gray explained the stakes at the White House strategy session. â€œWhatever form they ultimately take, the House and Senate â€October Surpriseâ€™ investigations, like Iran-Contra, will involve interagency concerns and be of special interest to the President,â€ Gray declared, according to minutes . [Emphasis in original.]
Among â€œtouchstonesâ€ cited by Gray were â€œNo Surprises to the White House, and Maintain Ability to Respond to Leaks in Real Time. This is Partisan.â€ White House â€œtalking pointsâ€ on the October Surprise investigation urged restricting the inquiry to 1979-80 and imposing strict time limits for issuing any findings.
Timid Democrats But Bushâ€™s White House really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received â€“ and a great deal arrived in December 1992 and January 1993 â€“ there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 Reagan campaign had conspired with Iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 Americans in order to ensure Reaganâ€™s election victory.
Former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana.
That would have undermined the faith of the American people in their democratic process â€“ and that, as Clark Clifford said in the 1968 context, would not be â€œgood for the country.â€
In 2014 when I sent a copy of Beachâ€™s memo regarding Caseyâ€™s trip to Madrid to former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, who had chaired the October Surprise inquiry in 1991-93, he told me that it had shaken his confidence in the task forceâ€™s dismissive conclusions about the October Surprise issue.
â€œThe [Bush-41] White House did not notify us that he [Casey] did make the tripâ€ to Madrid, Hamilton told me. â€œShould they have passed that on to us? They should have because they knew we were interested in that.â€
Asked if knowledge that Casey had traveled to Madrid might have changed the task forceâ€™s dismissive October Surprise conclusion, Hamilton said yes, because the question of the Madrid trip was key to the task forceâ€™s investigation.
â€œIf the White House knew that Casey was there, they certainly should have shared it with us,â€ Hamilton said, adding that â€œyou have to rely on peopleâ€ in authority to comply with information requests. But that trust was at the heart of the inquiryâ€™s failure. With the money and power of the American presidency at stake, the idea that George H.W. Bush and his team would help an investigation that might implicate him in an act close to treason was na¯ve in the extreme.
Arguably, Hamiltonâ€™s timid investigation was worse than no investigation at all because it gave Bushâ€™s team the opportunity to search out incriminating documents and make them disappear. Then, Hamiltonâ€™s investigative conclusion reinforced the â€œgroup thinkâ€ dismissing this serious manipulation of democracy as a â€œconspiracy theoryâ€ when it was anything but. In the years since, Hamilton hasnâ€™t done anything to change the public impression that the Reagan campaign was innocent.
Still, among the few people who have followed this case, the October Surprise cover-up would slowly crumble with admissions by officials involved in the investigation that its exculpatory conclusions were rushed , that crucial evidence had been hidden or ignored , and that some alibis for key Republicans didnâ€™t make any sense .
But the dismissive â€œgroup thinkâ€ remains undisturbed as far as the major U.S. media and mainstream historians are concerned.

Past as Prologue Lee Hamiltonâ€™s decision to â€œclearâ€ Reagan and Bush of the 1980 October Surprise suspicions in 1992 was not simply a case of miswriting history. The findings had clear implications for the future as well, since the public impression about George H.W. Bushâ€™s rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son, George W. Bush, in 2000.

Indeed, if the full truth had been told about the fatherâ€™s role in the October Surprise and Iran-Contra cases, itâ€™s hard to imagine that his son would have received the Republican nomination, let alone made a serious run for the White House. And, if that history were known, there might have been a stronger determination on the part of Democrats to resist another Bush â€œstolen electionâ€ in 2000.
Regarding Election 2000, the evidence is now clear that Vice President Al Gore not only won the national popular vote but received more votes that were legal under Florida law than did George W. Bush. But Bush relied first on the help of officials working for his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, and then on five Republican justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to thwart a full recount and to award him Floridaâ€™s electoral votes and thus the presidency.
The reality of Goreâ€™s rightful victory should have finally become clear in November 2001 when a group of news organizations finished their own examination of Floridaâ€™s disputed ballots and released their tabulations showing that Gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under Florida law were counted.
However, between the disputed election and the release of those numbers, the 9/11 attacks had occurred, so The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and other leading outlets did not want the American people to know that the wrong person was in the White House. Surely, telling the American people that fact amid the 9/11 crisis would not be â€œgood for the country.â€
So, senior editors at all the top new organizations decided to mislead the public by framing their stories in a deceptive way to obscure the most newsworthy discovery â€“ that the so-called â€œover-votesâ€ in which voters both checked and wrote in their choicesâ€™ names broke heavily for Gore and would have put him over the top regardless of which kinds of chads were considered for the â€œunder-votesâ€ that hadnâ€™t registered on antiquated voting machines. â€œOver-votesâ€ would be counted under Florida law which bases its standards on â€œclear intent of the voter.â€
However, instead of leading with Goreâ€™s rightful victory, the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given Florida narrowly to Bush. They either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurred.

On Nov. 12, 2001, the day that the news organizations ran those stories, I examined the actual data and quickly detected the evidence of Goreâ€™s victory. In a story that day, I suggested that senior news executives were exercising a misguided sense of patriotism. They had hid the reality for â€œthe good of the country,â€ much as Johnsonâ€™s team had done in 1968 regarding Nixonâ€™s sabotage of the Paris peace talks and Hamiltonâ€™s inquiry had done regarding the 1980 â€œOctober Surpriseâ€ case.
Within a couple of hours of my posting the article at Consortiumnews.com, I received an irate phone call from The New York Times media writer Felicity Barringer, who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of then-Times executive editor Howell Raines. I got the impression that Barringer had been on the look-out for some deviant story that didnâ€™t accept the Bush-won conventional wisdom.
However, this violation of objective and professional journalism â€“ bending the slant of a story to achieve a preferred outcome rather than simply giving the readers the most interesting angle â€“ was not simply about some historical event that had occurred a year earlier. It was about the future.
By misleading Americans into thinking that Bush was the rightful winner of Election 2000 â€“ even if the mediaâ€™s motivation was to maintain national unity following the 9/11 attacks â€“ the major news outlets gave Bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis, including the diversionary invasion of Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush-won headlines of November 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004. [For the details of how a full Florida recount would have given Gore the White House, see Consortiumnews.comâ€™s â€œ Goreâ€™s Victory ,â€ â€œ So Bush Did Steal the White House ,â€ and â€œ Bush v. Goreâ€™s Dark American Decade. â€]
A Phalanx of Misguided Consensus Looking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy, there appears to be one common element: after the â€œstolenâ€ elections, the media and political establishments quickly line up, shoulder to shoulder, to assure the American people that nothing improper has happened. Graceful â€œlosersâ€ are patted on the back for not complaining that the votersâ€™ will had been ignored or twisted.
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Al Gore is praised for graciously accepting the extraordinary ruling by Republican partisans on the Supreme Court, who stopped the counting of ballots in Florida on the grounds, as Justice Antonin Scalia said, that a count that showed Gore winning (when the Courtâ€™s majority was already planning to award the White House to Bush) would undermine Bushâ€™s â€œlegitimacy.â€
Similarly, Rep. Hamilton is regarded as a modern â€œwise man,â€ in part, because he conducted investigations that never pushed very hard for the truth but rather reached conclusions that were acceptable to the powers-that-be, that didnâ€™t ruffle too many feathers.
But the cumulative effect of all these half-truths, cover-ups and lies â€“ uttered for â€œthe good of the countryâ€ â€“ is to corrode the faith of many well-informed Americans about the legitimacy of the entire process. It is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times, or in this case, assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forest.
So, when Donald Trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him, many Americans choose to believe his demagogy. But Trump isnâ€™t pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000. He actually praises Republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
Trumpâ€™s complaints about â€œriggedâ€ elections are more in line with the white Southerners during Jim Crow, suggesting that black and brown people are cheating at the polls and need to have white poll monitors to make sure they donâ€™t succeed at â€œstealingâ€ the election from white people.
There is a racist undertone to Trumpâ€™s version of a â€œriggedâ€ democracy but he is not entirely wrong about the flaws in the process. Heâ€™s just not honest about what those flaws are.
The hard truth is that the U.S. political process is not democracyâ€™s â€œgold standardâ€; it is and has been a severely flawed system that is not made better by a failure to honestly address the unpleasant realities and to impose accountability on politicians who cheat the voters.
