According to KFYR, police made 16 arrests by evening time Thursday. 
â€œThe protesters are not being peaceful or prayerful. Law enforcement has been very methodical in moving ahead slowly as to not escalate the situation. However, the protesters are using very dangerous means to slow us down. Their aggressive tactics include using horses, fire and trying to flank us with horses and people,â€ said Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney in a press release Thursday. 16 arrests at DAPL todayâ€¦. #kfyrkafe

â€œMove to the south,â€ police said over the loudspeaker. 
â€œWe see some of you have bows. Do not shoot bows and arrows at us,â€ they added, as protesters laughed. 
National Guard troops and police removed tents and other possessions from the new encampment, which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe says is sacred land granted to them via treaty in 1851. 
Police also dismantled the barricade across the road. 
As police corralled the protesters southward, some activists remained facing the police and even engaged with them while walking backwards. Atsa Eâ€™sha Hoferer was livestreaming on Facebook, telling officers that they should be on the side of the protests and that they too would suffer from contaminated water should the pipeline burst. Police are pulling down tents now. Just saw them spray paint an X on a teepee. pic.twitter.com/nNrWRPDggP

The stand-off with police had lasted for several hours before authorties moved closer to the camp and started arresting people. The number of arrested is currently unclear. 
The protesters are currently blocking state Highway 1806, which law enforcement is attempting to clear using cop cars and military â€“ style vehicles. Police said they will defend themselves against horses if necessary #DAPL #NoDAPL pic.twitter.com/5yWqKBUeGW

Police have said that they will defend themselves against horses, journalist Wes Enzinna tweeted. 
â€œDo not ride horses at the police,â€ law enforcement announced. 
â€œYouâ€™re endangering peopleâ€™s lives by what youâ€™re doing,â€ police told the protesters, telling them to move south or be arrested. People will not be arrested if they return to the main camp, one officer said at the barricade. 
Protesters are burning tires, logs and other objects, sending smoke onto the roadway. A car has also been torched, journalist Jason Patinkin tweeted.

Although the Federal Aviation Administration has restricted flights over the Cannon Ball area until November 5, there is a police helicopter above the faceoff, journalist Antonia Juhasz tweeted. 
More than 260 protesters have been arrested in the weeks leading up to Thursdayâ€™s operation, AP reported. 
In the morning police made a line in front of the fence and the company workers are behind them. The tents of the so-called North Camp were located a stoneâ€™s throw away from the police line. Authorities insist that this camp should be removed, according to activist Atsa Eâ€™sha Hoferer live-streaming from the site. 
People on the barricades are retreating peacefully amid chants of â€œhands up, donâ€™t shoot!â€ 
People are moving from the road towards the construction site. â€œWe might as well get arrested defending the sacred,â€ a protester told the Bismarck Tribuneâ€™s Caroline Grueskin. We need to band together and keep the pressure up against them. One is a map of Native American reservations the other is the DAPL. #NoDAPL pic.twitter.com/VQ5MXgXkpY

Construction on the pipeline has resumed within sight of the confrontation on the state highway. While police came from north and things riled up, pipeline construction restarted to west. False flag much? pic.twitter.com/XxgC7vH11Z

â€œProtestersâ€™ escalated unlawful behavior this weekend by setting up illegal roadblocks, trespassing onto private property and establishing an encampment, has forced law enforcement to respond at this time. As I said yesterday, I visited the protesters roadblock and requested them to remove the barricade and have protesters vacate the private property. However, the spokesperson at the roadblock, Mekasi Camp-Horinek of Oklahoma, told law enforcement they â€were not movingâ€™,â€ Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said in a statement . â€œI canâ€™t stress it enough, this is a public safety issue. We cannot have protesters blocking county roads, blocking state highways, or trespassing on private property.â€ So @potus , this means you're going to remove the National Guard from Standing Rock and cancel DAPL, right? Right? #NoDAPL https://t.co/FVV5KsgUom
