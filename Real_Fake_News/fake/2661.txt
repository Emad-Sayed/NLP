It was over a year ago that the Clinton Campaign knew that Hillary Clinton had regularly used a private email server for official use, and they knew how incredibly stupid it was. 
In an email released by WikiLeaks , the now infamous Clinton staffer John Podesta sent a message to Clinton surrogate Neera Tanden. Podesta told her sheâ€™d be shown a new poll showing how Clinton is doing against Hillary and Jeb Bush. 
Tanden said she wasnâ€™t familiar with what the poll results would be, but she thought the email would be rough, IJR is reporting . 
â€œPS can you imagine what the Republicans would do to [Bernie] if he were the nominee?â€ 
To which Tanden replied: 
â€œWell, letâ€™s see what the poll actually says. 
Letâ€™s hope the Democratic party is not suicidal.â€ 
Then Podesta dropped the hammer: 
â€œDo we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And has that person been drawn and quartered? 
Like whole thing is fucking insane.â€ "Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And has that person been drawn and quartered?" https://t.co/jXc1mHi5vn

There have been 33,000 emails released from Podestaâ€™s server. They havenâ€™t confirmed their accuracy, but they certainly havenâ€™t denied them. It's been 3 weeks since @WikiLeaks began publishing Podesta emails. Not one doc has been claimed â€“ let alone demonstrated â€“ to be doctored.

Thereâ€™s more coming. We will have to see what comes of them, but thereâ€™s one takeaway from this: Clintonâ€™s people have known for a long time that she was using a personal server.
