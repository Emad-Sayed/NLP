Hillary Clinton is like a chameleon . 
Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams , whoâ€™s a trained hypnotist and observer of facial nuances, calls it an â€œunusual level of variabilityâ€ in her physical appearance. In his words, Hillary â€œlooks like an entirely different person every few days. See â€œ Chameleon Hillary Clinton is back to looking like sh*t â€” and the return of her medical handler â€ and â€œ Hillary Clintonâ€™s teeth, tongue-hole & now-you-see-it-now-you-donâ€™t wrinkles â€ 
On Monday, October 24, 2016, Hillary Clinton was in St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire for a rally , accompanied by â€œFauxcahontasâ€ Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). 
Close-up images of her face show that sheâ€™s morphed again, back to yellow teeth and a face crisscrossed with wrinkles. What happened to the porcelain-doll Hillary with dazzling-white teeth of the July 2016 Democratic National Convention? 
But this time, at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, thereâ€™s something even stranger. 
Tuesday, Matt Drudge tweeted two close-up images of Hillary at the NH rally, which show something embedded under the skin of her right cheek . Hereâ€™s the tweet: 
Here are the two images again, enlarged. I painted yellow arrows pointing to the lumps: 
According to plastic surgeons , Botox injections donâ€™t cause lumps under the skin. Dr. Richard Baxter explains that â€œBotox relaxes muscles that are hyperactive and so wrinkles caused by those muscles are smoothed,â€ but donâ€™t lead to lumps. Dr. Janet Turkle says that although â€œBotox injections can result in temporary bumps due to the injection,â€ the bumps last â€œonly a few minutesâ€. 
According to the American Academy of Facial Esthetics , however, â€œsome of the risks of facial injections are lumps (granulomas/nodules) which are a potential risks [sic] associated with Radiesse, Sculptra, Juvederm, and ArteColl.â€ 
Facial injections are injections of facial fillers such as collagen, hyaluronic acid and calcium hydroxyl apatite that rejuvenate facial skin by reducing or eliminating wrinkles, raising scar depressions, enhancing lips and replacing soft-tissue volume loss.
