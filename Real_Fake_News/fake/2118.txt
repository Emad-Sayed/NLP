A Suffolk University/USA Today poll released Friday found that 75.9% of Americans believe the mainstream media â€œwould like to see [Hillary Clinton] elected president.â€ 
The poll also found that only 10% of Americans believe that â€œforeign interests such as Russian hackersâ€ are â€œthe primary threat that might try to change the election resultsâ€. In contrast, 45.53% believe â€œthe news mediaâ€ is the primary threat to the election: 
Indeed, the New York Times , Boston Globe , Los Angeles Times , CNN and other mainstream media admitted to us they were going to try to throw the election for Hillary. (And leaked emails show widespread collusion between the media and the Clinton campaign.)
