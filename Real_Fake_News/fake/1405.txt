Elderly Woman Spots Drone Above Propertyâ€¦ Her Next Move Leaves Operators STUNNED 
Hough recalled waking up to the sound of glass breaking and footsteps inside his home as the intruder used a rock to smash out a sliding glass door. 
â€œIt was a strong guy, a big guy,â€ Hough said, referencing his broken door. â€œI wouldnâ€™t have been able to kick that out.â€ 
Grabbing his revolver, Hough took up a defensive position at the top of the stairs and waited until he saw the man who had broken into his home.   
â€œI knew pretty much where he was,â€ he explained. â€œHe came across my dining room and to the foot of my stairway. I had a revolver and fired at him twice.â€ 
Though he didnâ€™t hit the burglar with his two shots, they were more than enough to send the punk scrambling back out the broken glass door and away from what turned out to be a well-defended home. 
â€œI missed, obviously, but I think I scared him,â€ Hough added, pointing to the bullet holes in his wall. â€œHe certainly didnâ€™t expect to see me.â€ 
The armed homeowner used his cellphone to call the police, who responded promptly despite the raging hurricane going on around them.
