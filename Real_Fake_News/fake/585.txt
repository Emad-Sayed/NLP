This election is going to have unprecedented political infidelity. A good 20 percent of husbands for Trump predict their wife wonâ€™t vote with them. This is wrong for a number of reasons but the biggie is, a family is supposed to be a cohesive unit. He canâ€™t have his better half canceling out his vote. Even if a husband wants to vote badlyâ€”say, for Hillaryâ€”his wife should stand by her man and make the same mistake. Nobodyâ€™s saying there canâ€™t be discussions and women shouldnâ€™t have their own political beliefs, but the final decision comes down to the guy paying the bills and she should abide by that. This is counterintuitive because we live in a feminist fantasyland, but itâ€™s really the same as deciding where your family is going to live. A married couple agree where theyâ€™re going to go based on whatâ€™s best for the kids. If he gets an amazing job offer in Cleveland but sheâ€™s a city gal from Manhattan, she needs to accept that Ohio is best for the future of their family. Voting is the same. Youâ€™re deciding where the country is going to go based on whatâ€™s best for future generations. 
Unfortunately, this is not happening. A map of America â€œif just men votedâ€ is almost completely red, whereas a map of America â€œif just women votedâ€ is almost completely blue. The maps donâ€™t differentiate between married and single, but judging by this massive split in what gender likes what candidate, we can assume the married map would be similar. Single people are a lost cause anyway. The women vote almost exclusively out of spite. They are voting for Hillary because she has a pussy, they hate Trump because he grabbed one, and they elected Obama because he makes theirs wet (they elected Trudeau because he is one). As for single men, Iâ€™m not convinced they even vote . There are also stay-at-home dads and situations where the woman is the breadwinner. This is awkward, but if youâ€™ve made her the patriarch then her husband (a.k.a. wife) needs to vote with her. For the most part, however, weâ€™re talking about a home where the father makes the lionâ€™s share of the money and the womanâ€™s contribution is using her magic powers to make babies. They have a symbiotic relationship where theyâ€™re both utilizing their greatest strengths. Patriarchs are best at driving, so heâ€™s the helmsman. He doesnâ€™t want to fight about it because he doesnâ€™t want to rock the boat, but for her to turn starboard while heâ€™s going port is to split everything in half and now the whole family is drowning. Voting against your husband is a tiny divorce.
