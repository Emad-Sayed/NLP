ALERT â€“ New Bill Clinton Mistress Confirmed, Hillary Camp Panicsâ€¦ Oct 28, 2016 Previous post The identity of one of Bill Clintonâ€™s long-time mistresses was just revealed. The former presidentâ€™s Secret Service detail nicknamed the mistress â€œEnergizerâ€ because of the way Bill always â€œperked upâ€ and seemed revitalized after her visits. Julie McMahon has been outed by the press as Bill Clintonâ€™s â€œEnergizer,â€ a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Energizer Bunny. This mother of three and socialite has publicly denied being one of Clintonâ€™s lovers, but a plethora of purported evidence is now unfolding online in an effort to refute McMahonâ€™s claims of innocence, as per Bizpac Review . McMahon reportedly lives just a few minutes away from Bill and Hillary Clintonâ€™s home in New York, which is called Whitehaven. If the Clintons were Republicans, the liberal mainstream media would be calling them racists over the chosen name of their luxurious estate. Always, Julia McMahon would arrive at Whitehaven via SUV. She would only stay a few hours sometimes, but other times she would spend an entire week at the Clinton residence. Julia McMahon reportedly met both Bill and Hillary in 1998 when he was president. Although the Clinton campaign has tried to label McMahon a friend to both of the Clintons, she only visited or spent the night at the house when Hillary wasnâ€™t home, the Daily Mail reports. Sometimes, McMahon allegedly arrived just mere minutes after the departure of the former first lady. The Secret Service agents on the Clinton Whitehaven detail were reportedly not ever privy to the womanâ€™s name, but they were allegedly under strict orders not to approach or stop her when she arrived. Every member of a presidentâ€™s family is protected by a Secret Service detail. The Secret Service reportedly uses the same letter to assign a codename to protectees. Bill Clintonâ€™s Secret Service name is reportedly â€œEagleâ€ and Hillaryâ€™s is â€œEvergreen.â€ The Secret Service may have run out of â€œEâ€ codenames over the years thanks to all of Billâ€™s lady friends.
