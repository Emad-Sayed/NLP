This entire election season has been insane and no one has broken it down like Seth Meyers has in his nightly segments A Closer Look. 
On the eve of the election, Meyers decided to focus this segment on how the two candidates have handled their campaigns during the final stretch. He took a few minor shots at Hillary, but the bulk of his time was spent incredulously trying to make sense out of what has gone on with Trump during the last 3 days in particular. He also shares a highly entertaining clip of President Obamaâ€™s â€œburnsâ€ on Trump. 
While Hillary Clinton has been campaigning with mega-stars like Katy Perry, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Bruce Springsteen and Lady Gaga, Trump hasâ€¦Scott Baio. Trump couldnâ€™t seem to stop whining about Hillaryâ€™s celebrities all weekend, even saying how horrible and inappropriate Jay-Zâ€™s lyrics were. Yes. Thisâ€¦coming from the man who inspired the newest phrase â€œp*ssygateâ€ and had the likes of Ted Nugent grabbing his crotch and referencing his â€œblue ballsâ€ at a rally over the weekend. 
After showing a clip of Trump bitching about all of these A-listers and saying he doesnâ€™t need them or their guitars and pianos, Seth had a message for the Republican candidate: 
â€œThatâ€™s okay, Iâ€™ve got an instrument for you Donald â€” the worldâ€™s smallest violin,â€ Meyers said. â€œIt should be noted that with your hands, it would be a regular size violin.â€
