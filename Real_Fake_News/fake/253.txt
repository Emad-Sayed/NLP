November 14, 2016 â€Communication within this company just infuriates me,â€™ said insufferable manager Steven Parker, after tweeting the same remark to his 3 online followers. â€The silo mentality is toxic and we need to break down organisational barriers so that fundamental knowledge is shared. This firm is a breeding ground for interdepartmental turf wars, and we must implement some basic cross-functional solutionsâ€™. 
Steven continued shouting quite loudly at every available opportunity about a matter of negligible significance â€“ a chain email entitled: â€Stationery cupboard low on blue pensâ€™. 
Mr. Parker runs his own family business and that his 2 support staff, wife Jenny and daughter Emma, completely despise him. jonessgl
