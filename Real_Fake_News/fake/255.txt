We do not like trampolining, say hedgehogs 10-11-16 
HEDGEHOGS have confirmed they do not like trampolining and children should not make them do it. 
Britainâ€™s hedgehogs attacked this yearâ€™s John Lewis Christmas advert, featuring trampolining woodland animals, warning that children would now try to kidnap hedgehogs and force them to bounce up and down. 
Hedgehog Roy Hobbs said: â€œI accidentally wandered across a trampoline once. I hated it and I wasnâ€™t even bouncing up and down. It was just all wobbly underfoot. Made me queasy. 
â€œThe hedgehog in this advert is not real. It is an unnatural, computer generated abomination.â€ 
Hobbs added: â€œHedgehogs are very much ground-based creatures. We eat grubs and roll into a ball for protection. 
â€œIn our leisure time we watch stuff like Bake Off and Orange is the New Black . The most excitement we have is the occasional game of Buckaroo!. 
â€œAnyway, keep your brats on a leash or weâ€™ll give them scabies.â€
